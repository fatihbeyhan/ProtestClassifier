Possibly there cannot be a better relief to the wrecked lives of such women. However, there are women who are still outside its ambit and not eligible for maintenance, the women who have been cheated by such men and who are unwed mothers. I hope the day is not far away when the court will rule that the cheated unwed mothers too are eligible for maintenance. S. Rama Chandra Rao Visakhapatnam Farmers’ woes Cyclone Phailin and the torrential rains that followed have devastated standing crops on thousands of hectares in Srikakulam district. The plight of the farmers is heart-rending. It is unfortunate that no political leader has expressed empathised with affected farmers. The Congress-led UPA Government at the Centre has shown its callousness in pushing forward its agenda to divide the State while the common man is crying for relief from the natural calamity and some compensation for the colossal loss to the crops. A.V.L. Bhujanga Rao Visakhapatnam Epidemic threat The action of GVMC Commissioner M.V. Satyanarayana in taking steps to prevent outbreak of contagious diseases after the rains go away is laudable. Contamination of water, breeding of mosquitoes and quick non-removal of trash are the main contributors to causing epidemics and they should be addressed first. Politicians must allow the uninterrupted attention of the officials for relief work. Ganti Mahapatruni Rama Rao Visakhapatnam Address problems in Rythu Bazaar After rains, the conditions inside and outside the Rythu Bazaar in Seethammadhara become unbearable. In the absence of good drainage system, water stagnates in front of the stalls and it is difficult to stand there to buy vegetables. Further, water stagnates at all the three entrances to the Rythu Bazaar that makes it difficult to enter the market. The garbage bin outside the market emanating foul smell and after a rain it gets worse. The authorities need to take immediate steps to address these problems. P. Kurmeswara Rao Visakhapatnam",0

Judge Peter Murphy delivered the landmark judgment on September 16 in the context of a 21-year-old Muslim woman (referred to only as D in the judgment) who appeared in his court as defendant in a case of witness intimidation. Laying out sharply argued reasons for his decision, the judge noted that the question of whether a woman may give evidence wearing a niqaab had become “the elephant in the courtroom”, and that it called for a defining principle of law. The judge drew a distinction between a niqaab -wearing woman standing for trial and giving evidence. Permitting D to stand for trial with her face covered, he stated that she must give evidence with her face clearly visible to the “judge, the jury, and counsel” if fairness of trial and justice is to be served. Mr. Justice Murphy said D should be “given time to reflect and take advice if she wishes to do so”, to remove her niqaab . “If she refuses, the judge should not allow her to give evidence, and must give the jury a clear direction…about the defendant’s failure to give evidence.” His argument, which drew from case laws of other countries and interpretations of Muslim law, allowed for exceptions and “accommodations”. For example, he said that a woman with a niqaab could appear as a witness, a juror, or an advocate; could wear it in civil or family courts “in which other considerations may come into play”; or in an airport where she could be taken to another room by a woman officer for a security check. The argument for a judicial principle to be set only pertains to a trial court in an “adversarial trial” where women appear as defendants. Hiding the face in an adversarial trial in the Crown Court “may impede credibility assessment by the trier of fact, be it judge or jury”, Mr. Justice Murphy stated. On fundamental right Responding to the central argument put forward by D’s counsel, namely, that giving evidence is a fundamental right, he said that this right “must be seen in context…[it] involves a corresponding duty to submit that evidence to the scrutiny of the jury.” The judge said that he rejected the view that the niqaab is “somehow incompatible with participation in public life in England and Wales; or is nothing more than a form of abuse, imposed under the guise of religion, on women by men. There may be individual cases where that is true. But the niqaab is worn by choice by many spiritually-minded, thoughtful and intelligent women, who do not deserve to be demeaned by superficial and uninformed criticisms of their choice.” With 4.8 million Muslims in the U.K., half of them women (of whom a majority do not wear the veil), the judgment will doubtless provide the anchor of reasoned law in a debate fraught with disagreement, and in which the voices of Muslim women are rarely heard.",0

He said the fishermen had launched the strike expecting the Central and State governments to take steps and secure the release of the arrested fishermen but they remained silent. On the other hand, the Lankan authorities have remanded the fishermen in judicial custody, he said. The decision to call off the strike was taken considering the livelihood of the fishermen and their poor family background. Most of the families of 3,000-odd country boat fishermen were struggling to make both ends meet, he said. He said country boat and mechanised boat fishermen in the island would strike work on January 9 and observe a fast to condemn the arrest of the fishermen by the Lankan navy.

V. Mysoora Reddy called off his two-day roadside protest against the Government's decision to fence off the only passage leading to his house in Banjara Hills here on Monday, following an appeal made by party president N. Chandrababu Naidu. That the Government's move smacked of political vendetta could be gauged from the fact that it has fenced off a 100 yard passage and put up a ""Trespassers will be prosecuted"" board, leaving out the abutting vast three acre Government land worth Rs. 100 crores, Dr. Reddy told presspersons. He accused the Government of granting exemption from Urban Land Ceiling Act and ""gifting"" away this three-acre land to an individual Madan Mohanlal Sriram for building a hotel in violation of the existing rules. He said the Government had issued 180 GOs granting similar exemptions involving 250 acres of prime land in and around the city, worth Rs. 1,000 crores and demanded a judicial inquiry into the ""scam"". While appealing to Dr. Reddy to call off his protest, Mr. Naidu charged the Congress Government with developing a dictatorial streak, seen in the way it was liquidating TDP leaders and workers, stifling the voice of the Opposition and filing defamation cases against Opposition leaders and the media. The action was politically motivated as Dr. Reddy got an assurance from the Revenue and Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad officials to use the passage till the sump, which was there on the portion he had given away for road widening, was shifted and the access ramp to the house laid. This was before he left for Kadapa but on the same night, barbed wire was installed and a board put up. ""Obviously the officials were acting on the orders of the political leadership. We will not be cowed down by such threats and we will fight it out in Assembly and outside,"" the TDP leader said.",0

Offered as postgraduate certificate or diploma courses in several universities across the country, there has been a steady increase in people’s interest in taking up publishing as a career. Publishing course administrators say that while the course attracts many freshers, many people opt for publishing when looking for a change in their careers. “There has been a gradual rise in people’s interest in pursuing publishing. Many of our students happened to come across our course while scouring the Internet for publishing courses. We look for candidates with a very good grasp of English for the editing course while for the designing skill, we look for candidates with very good creative and aesthetic senses,” says spokesperson of Seagull School of Publishing, Smita Abraham. Certificate courses Located in Kolkata, the Seagull School of Publishing — an initiative of the Seagull Foundation for the Arts, Kolkata, in association with Seagull Books and supported by the Royal Norwegian Embassy, New Delhi — offers three-month certificate courses twice a year in editing and book designing. Run by professionals, besides lessons taught in classrooms, students are given a tour of a printing press. While placements are not guaranteed, their students are now working for various renowned publishing houses across the country, says Abraham. The postgraduate diploma in book publishing at IGNOU offers a year-long course, and students get the opportunity of undergoing a month-long apprenticeship at a publishing house. The training is supported by the Federation of Indian Publishers, with whom IGNOU has a tie-up and successful students receive a joint degree from IGNOU and the Federation. Similar one-year postgraduate diploma courses are offered by the Calcutta University in Kolkata (in collaboration with the National Book Trust and Publishers and Booksellers Guild, Kolkata) and the Ambedkar University in Delhi (in collaboration with the National Book Trust). Describing the interest in publishing from college freshers as ‘encouraging’, Ratnesh Kumar Jha, MD, Cambridge University Press, South Asia, says there has been an increasing rise in young employees from colleges like Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, Kolkata’s Jadavpur University, etc. College freshers are given the opportunity to work on specific projects, for example, working on science textbooks. Despite the rapid spread of digitisation, the appeal of printed books has not dimmed which is why the interest in publishing has not faded. Although the pay is relatively less in the publishing industry, people opt for it for the love of books, says Abraham, adding that publishing offers an individual the liberty to freelance and work from home.",0

In fact, she learnt to read and write after her marriage and loved to read.” Also, the air in Maharashtra was thick with the values that Anna Karve was spreading – he continued the remarkable work of the Phules and promoted women’s education in every corner of Maharashtra. “My whole generation of women were created in this climate, not just me,” explains Vijaya. Boys and girls of her times were all a part of some volunteer group like the Seva Dal or some other, and Vijaya was a committed sainika in the Jayaprakash Narayan movement. “When I went to theatre, I was a product of the Renaissance of art…. How could we wish away any of these…?” she asks. Her entry into theatre was a happenstance. “One of my professors at college said, ‘do something interesting’. I tried doing theatre in college, and after those 15 minutes, I never retracted.” In fact, her family was happy with her involvement with JP and were rather worried when she decided on theatre. But they were glad that she didn’t choose cinema. Curiously, Vijaya’s aunt was the actor Nalini Jayawant and her cousins, the famous yesteryear stars Tanuja and Nutan. By the time she was 18, theatre was a major force in her life. Along with friends such as Arvind Deshpande, Shriram Lagoo, Bhaskar Chandavarkar and Vijay Tendulkar, Vijaya Mehta had set up her own theatre group Rangayan. She recalls the times that they all spent together after the Bhulabhai Memorial Institute had been set up. “ Painters M.F. Husain, Akbar Padamsee and Gaitonde did their paintings in their studios here. In another room Ravi Shankar used to hold rehearsals of his group called Kinnar. Sachin Shankar worked on his ballet in one room and sculptor Piloo Pochkhanwala worked in a shed. We too got a tiny space. We had very little money, yet we were able to do path breaking work.” Some of the best experimental theatre in Mumbai in the 1970s was done in the Spartan hall of the Chhabildas school in Dadar. During the thick of her theatre activities, Vijaya got married to actor Durga Khote’s son Harin. Few years into their marriage, Harin died, leaving Vijaya and their two sons. “The challenge was to make it work and not be browbeaten….” One day, she remembers Durga Khote calling her over: “I am there for you. However, you must take up a job and restart your life. You must get married again. For now, if you wish I can give you a job in Durga Khote productions. But I insist, you must be independent…,” she had advised Vijaya. Vijaya later got married to Faroque Mehta, but kept her theatre and theatre research alive. When her husband had to go to Germany, Vijaya closed down Rangayan and left with him. She worked with Fritz Benewitz for several years. In the later years, she, along with Bhaskar Chandavarkar and others did a project in ritualistic Sanskrit theatre, staying in Kerala with Madhav Chakyar studying Koodiyattam. She used the traditional Sanskritic idiom to do modern theatre, for instance, she recalls how she infused those elements into Mudra Rakshasa, Shakuntala and some of the Girish Karnad plays she did. “I got an opportunity to go the US and study the landscape of American theatre. It was the peak of the Feminist movement. I just found it appalling that women were wearing men’s clothes. Does equality mean looking like men? I had seen such strong women back home. Without uttering a word of feminism, they stood to change many things within tradition itself by their sheer inner strength.” Self pity, is a death nail, she says. “There are miseries, but never use it as a tool to destroy yourself.” Vijaya acted in films, went on to head institutions like NCPA and NSD, made the remarkable television serial Lifeline , but her heart was always in theatre. “A film took away two years from my life,” she reasons. “I have had very fruitful experiences in doing Shyam Benegal’s The Rani of Jhansi, Pestonjee, Party and others… but I wanted to more interesting things.” It is very satisfying when you do things for their own sake, says Vijaya. “I was always totally in love with my work. Popularity, fame and other things take their own course. But I believed, love thy art not yourself…,” she says holding my hand, as we get up to leave.",0

Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Goel also issued fresh bailable warrants to ensure appearance of an approver in the 37-year-old case. Defence lawyers insisted that the approver be present in court during final arguments as the court could withdraw the pardon it granted to him at any time.

Sharma explained the history of the Ananda Marga, the various wings of this organisation, its publications, and the arrest of Anandamurti in 1971 that led to a clear demarcation between its members who pursued a spiritual path and those who allegedly wanted to take up violence to free their leader. Mr. Sharma said the objective of the Ananda Marga was to establish a parallel government of moralists in the country and it was served by a cadre of whole-time workers known as Avadutas.

Is wasabi the new black truffle? Is Wagyu beef the new caviar? Asian chefs are storming the world of international food, armed with the obligatory knowledge of French cooking techniques — which helps get a foot in the door — and then going on to rewrite the rules, inspired by century-old culinary customs, tried-and-tested family recipes and colourful traditional ingredients. Fuelling all this is the increasingly adventurous Asian foodie, enthusiastic about experimenting with daring new foods and flavours, and yet fiercely loyal to ‘home' food. The newly launched Miele guide — a product, to declare my association upfront, I was in a way involved with — takes a look into the increasingly-dynamic Asian food scene. The annual guide, which attempts to showcase Asia's finest restaurants thereby promoting Asian chefs, food and flavours, seems to be becoming quite influential given it's only in its second year. One reason could be because of its novelty: Surprisingly Asia's never had a professionally produced independent guide of this sort. In fact, with its reputation for cheap, quick and delicious food, Asia for a long time was not even much of a contender on the cutting-edge fine dining scene, which has been dominated by France, California and lately Australia. The 2009/2010 Miele edition took into account opinions of food writers from every major region (80 in all) and the public leading to a shortlist of 2,200 restaurants. The final selection was based upon the over 98,000 votes cast from 98 countries, as well as the Miele's jury of 1,500 food professionals and journalists. The slim edition finally features about 450 restaurants. Indian flavours India does feature, but is overshadowed dramatically by China, Japan and Indonesia. While Indian food is undeniably sophisticated, the country's chefs seem to play it safe in comparison with their counterparts in Shangai, Tokyo and Singapore. Bukhara, the only restaurant that makes the top 20, is practically stodgy with tradition. Our chefs often say they're handicapped by the fact that customers don't appreciate experimentation with Indian food. However, to get attention like Heston Blumenthals, Ferran Adrias and Thomas Kellers of the world, innovation, creativity and presentation certainly need to go up several notches. Asia is best known for its boisterous dining and fuss-free food. But for fine dining, innovative ambience is key. After all a great restaurant should be an experience. Ku De Ta in Bali, leapt into No. 9 this year largely because of the drama of its architecture. While the guide says the food is good, it admits the restaurant stands out because it's “a scene and one of the best on the world” with its “fantastically good-looking clientele, great sounds and sexy interior theme.” Tweaking fresh, local ingredients with international twists seems to be another way Asian chefs are turning heads. At Iggy's, the top restaurant, Wagyu strip loin is served with watercress lightly tossed in piquant Japanese goma (sesame) dressing. At Mozaic in Bali, there's pan fried foie gras paired with sweet and sour young Balinese starfruit broth. At Laris, in Shangai, David Laris chef-proprietor calls his food ‘contemporary, which signifies a freedom from ethnic labels.' His Australian-Greek heritage, grounding in French classics, experience in Macau, Hong Kong, Hanoi come together to create food like a coriander laced mussel stir fry. Asia's strength has always been traditional recipes, passed on for generations. And judging by Hong Kong's Yung Ki, (exulting in food such as roast goose, tea smoked pork belly and platefuls of tiny rice birds), which comes in at No. 10, staying true to your roots certainly pays off long-term. However experimentation is what keeps dining exciting. Vietnam's top five restaurants, for instance, all feature chefs who are exploring ways of recreating Indo-Chinese and global cuisines with subtlety and flair. India's top five celebrates our rich culinary heritage. But then that's a laurel we've always had. Perhaps it's time our undeniably brilliant chefs stop resting on it.",0

He appealed to the officials to construct water storage points or dams inside the forest to prevent deaths of deer, an endangered species under Schedule I of The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Over the last four months, four deer were killed either in road accidents and by dogs at Kayatar, Cholapuram and Eeratchi.

Some time back it was Rolling Stones, now it is Iron Maiden. Scot McFadyen and Sam Dunn here capture some ecstatic moments of the first leg of the band’s “Somewhere Back in Time” world tour in high definition format. Emerging in the 1980s, the band which made us “Run to the Hills” continues to be relevant today because it is not concerned about its relevance. It may not have the variety, the freshness, but whatever it has is special…..lasting. No “Fear of the Dark”! And that magic comes through as the crew follows the band in 21 cities spread across four continents. From spellbound youngsters in Mumbai and Bangalore to doting teenage girls in Japan, their Heavy Metal induces extreme reactions. They are back on the road after years, but as drummer Nicko McBrain, the gregarious side of the sextet, says, nothing much has changed in front. In South America they still evoke a kind of religious fervour that has to be seen to be believed. Fans in the volatile Columbia camp in the open a week before the show to secure their desired spot to listen to Bruce Dickinson and company. As a young fan melts into tears, it becomes evident how music blurs nationalities and races. For those who do not religiously follow the English band, Bruce is not only the lead singer but also a trained pilot. And the big idea to fly in a customised Boeing 747 to rekindle the love for Eddie germinated in his creative mind. Steve Harris continues to be the spirit behind the band, the man who gives the riffs a new meaning with his imaginative lyrics, and Dave Murray is the one to whom every member turns during emotional upheavals. Janick Gers is the queer type, one who does his own thing, sometimes even in the midst of a performance! In between some head-banging stuff we get to know that Nicko is not all about thumping the drums. He enjoys the subtleties of golf. Bands are about bonding, but these people do follow personal interests and lives. Like Adrian Smith, who loves tennis and is quite good at it. It’s true that without music life would be a mistake, but this film here now is just too indulgent to make sense to people who are not devoted to Iron Maiden. It doesn’t ask difficult questions. It becomes clear in the beginning that the members are not going to reveal any big secrets. But you feel disappointed when they even don’t share the creation of a song, its life from ideation to performance with certain examples. Yes, you do get to see backstage manoeuvres, but only obvious stuff – things like tonnes of equipment and the enormous magnitude of realising a performance. Those expecting to be told what really happens at the back of the mind of rock stars – how The Rime of the Ancient Mariner came into being – are going to come out disappointed. Still, compulsive stuff for Maiden addicts! (Wave, Noida, and other theatres) A mother understands what a child does not say. But does the child understand what his mother wants? We deposit all our worries with her, but where does she go to share her sentiments? Meg Ryan plays Martha, a mother who lost her partner and with him the zest for life. One day when she rediscovers it, she goes into overdrive. She sheds pounds and with them her inhibitions. Her FBI agent son (Colin Hanks) finds it odd, but the mother wants to have a blast. She finds her match in an art thief (Antonio Banderas), but things take a turn when the son is asked to keep a tab on his mother to catch the thief. Obviously there is more to it than what meets the eye, but as the son finds himself in an embarrassing situation when he is forced to hear the pillow talk between his mother and her new boyfriend, we get prospects of some hilarious situations. Alas! Director George Gallo is not up to the job. He has handled a riveting plot in a lacklustre fashion. The dialogue is cheesy, the characters chiselled out of cardboard and the situations unexplored. There is no real attempt to explore the relationships between the mother and son and between the mother and her prospective daughter-in-law. Meg tries hard to bring sanity to a wafer-thin plot, but the scriptwriter has made sure that the actors must indulge in some puerile stuff to earn their presence. Antonio Banderas cruises on his reputation of a beefcake who can effortlessly make your heart quiver but hardly ever strikes the grey matter. Colin Hanks looks utterly confused as he is required to be. Try this one only if you have nothing better to do this weekend.",0

Some do theatre for a living and some others because theatre, they believe, can bring about a change. The last may be right because a play on child labour staged in the slums of Hyderabad actually helped six child labours go back to school. How? “The parents of the children understood the need for education and hence the change,” says director Rammohan Holagundi of Nishumbita Theatre Group that staged that play. Similarly, a play on water conservation brought up a healthy debate on ways to ensure sensible water usage. There are many such examples of the group working to bring about a change Ram is happy that the group’s plays sometimes do not end up in fancy venues but succeed in reaching the audience they are aimed at. “We have been doing street plays for a cause, in fact that is how I began,” recollects Ram. His work with street plays have attracted attention of the Americans. Ram has recently been selected to participate in the International Visitors Leadership Program (IVLP) on Promoting Social Change Through the Arts sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. Ram the only representative from the country to the IVLP which is one of the U.S. government's prestigious professional exchange programs for foreign opinion leaders. “The US consulate in the Hyderabad met me and interviewed me and then since there was no news, I was almost shutting my thought on the programme when I received word of my application being forwarded to Delhi and then to Washington. That is how the selection takes place. The joy for being selected is beyond bounds because I hadn’t applied for it by myself. Seeing my work, the representative from the city picked my name and contacted me,” smiles Ram. Ram says the programme, where more than 130,000 participants — including 300 current and former heads of government — have visited the United States, is a privilege. “Many key members of Indian politics and society have participated in this program in the past, including former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former presidents K R Narayanan and Pratibha Patil. The idea of the program is to explore the geographic, ethnic, and religious diversity of the U.S. population and how innovative arts programming can be instrumental in managing conflicts, personal and community healing, and promoting peace, tolerance, and mutual understanding,” elaborates Ram. As an IVLP exchange person, Ram will be interacting with artistes and theatre activists from across the world, sharing ideas and information about India arts and culture and particularly the theatre scenario in our country.

Slides, maps, clips and films were put together by Oliver Noone, physician and history buff, to evoke a vital chapter of the region’s past. History was the talking point at the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium on Thursday as the Central Government Officers Welfare Association organised Noone’s lecture on ‘The Battle of Tarvananghurry’. Through this seemingly obscure battle in the neighbourhood, in today’s Tirurangadi to be precise, Noone sought to explain the dynamics of war and colonisation. The 1790 battle was vital to the British who were looking to redeem a lost empire post American Independence, pointed out Noone. Noone’s own interest in this battle spurred from personal relationships. During his three-decade long stay in Britain, he came across his friend Derek’s family history in the book, The Hearsey’s – Five Generations of an Anglo-Indian Family . Noone discovered that one of Derek’s ancestors, Andrew Hearsey, served in the “capture of the very important strong fort in Palghat.” The journey began there. Through many vignettes and navigating through “14 kms of material on India” at the library in Britain, Noone pieced together the Battle of Tarvananghurry. “The site of battle is near Chemmad and what remains there today is the Kadalundi River,” said Noone. He compared the current map of the region with the Survey of India – 1800 and a notable absentee emerged to be a fort of Tipu. Ways of war It is the moves that make a war that interests Noone. He spent considerable time explaining strategies, canon capacity and war moves. “The use of science and technology” by the aggressors, he often noted, did us in. He recounted how in 1503, the Portuguese met the mighty fleet of Zamorin with just “five caravels, three large carracks and 10 other crafts.” Similarly, he pointed out, in the Battle of Tarvananghurry, the British met Tipu’s forces with just three regiments. Noone’s fascination with history is spurred by curiosity—of how a small country conquered another many times over its size and strength. He said the British had a no-holds-barred approach when it came to war tactics. So Tipu worried them with his keen “geo-political sense”, pointed out Noone. Hence conquering Tipu’s men was a noteworthy gain, he added. Britain then was on a mission to “redeem a lost empire” and so placed the Tarvananghurry battle highly. It even triggered a letter of appreciation from Lord Cornwallis to his men who fought at Tarvananghurry, pointed out Noone. P. A",0

They look alike at first glance but there are some differences between the two. Frogs have smooth, moist skin and are good jumpers; toads have broader bodies, drier warty skin and move in short clumsy hops. Frogs generally live in or around a pond or a stream, whereas toads can stay in drier land. Toads are considered to be more intelligent than frogs. Frogs tend to leap off suddenly to defend themselves. They may, for instance, jump off blindly from a table regardless of its height. Toads are slower and more predictable in their movements and would probably walk over to the edge of the table and look before taking the plunge. Toads also learn fairly quickly. After doing it for about six times they learn that bees are not good to eat and remember this for about six weeks. They have a remarkable homing instinct too. If taken away from their favourite resting place they will return to the spot even if they are left a kilometre away from it. The largest known frog is the rare West African Goliath frog. It is 66 cm long and weighs about 4.5 kg. One of the largest toads is the giant or the marine toad. It is over 20 cm in length. The largest known giant toad was a captive toad named 'The Prince'. Prince died at the age of 12 in Sweden. It weighed 3.7 kg at the time of its death. Frogs and toads are found everywhere, except Antarctica.",0

But Archana Venkatesan’s translation of Nammalvar’s Tiruviruttam is time well spent. The 255-page slender volume is a must-have for lovers of Tamil Vaishnavite literature and, in general, lovers of metaphor-laden love poems. Among the 12 Vaishnavite saints who sang in Tamil during the Bhakti movement, Nammalvar of Alwar Tirunagari is a favourite for many. His chosen metre was the andadi , in which the last word of the stanza is also the first of the next. Nammalvar is said to have lived in the ninth century and, by the time of Tirumangai Alvar, his verses had achieved religious sanction as integral parts of temple ritual. His verse continues to excite devotees and lovers of literature alike for many reasons. First, it’s the rhyme and rhythm in his words; second, the superbly terse, succinct use of those words. Not one word is out of place, each contributing to creating a vision of Narayana as all-pervading, generous, and willing to enter into the devotee’s heart and take him to his abode. Though the 100 verses of Tiruviruttam are linked to each other by words and a general meaning, they are independent poems speaking of the heroine’s yearning for her hero, Tirumal or Narayana. For Vaishnava scholars, the love poems are anyapadesa or an outer coat that protects the svapadesa , the esoteric import that speaks of the soul’s yearning to unite with the supreme. The Tiruviruttam needs to be read carefully to be understood. For this purpose alone, the book is an absolute essential in a world where the pain of separation from a loved one is still real. None of the poems offer a solution but reminds us that those who master the verses “won’t ever be trapped in the quicksand of delusory birth, its wicked fate, the misery of this false world.” The book also has Periyavachan Pillai’s commentary on the text for six selected verses (one for each of the characters), indexes of characters, motifs, myths, places (though Udayagiri strikes a discordant note as the Tamil text doesn’t mention it as specifically) and names that can help those searching the text to get information quickly. It is a relief to see the tulasi referred to as tulay ( thuzhai would have been better), the Tamil word, rather than basil, which is the wrong plant altogether! Here are a couple of examples of the translation: Little worms that live in a wound/ Do what they do./ What do they know of the world?/ I learned these songs from the cunning Tirumal/ Who uses me to sing of himself./ It’s like people making meaning/ From the chirp of a lizard. (Verse 48) She said –/ Like a monkey tossing aside a ruby/ Evening falls/ Casting aside the golden sun/ O precious gem who measured worlds/ My beloved emerald/ Golden one who has no equal/ You’re the sole refuge of your servant’s life. The book brings this complex work to a larger audience. One hopes that dancers and other performers will seek to interpret these metaphors and love imagery using this book. One also hopes that, as the author completes her translation of Nammalvar’s Thiruvaimozhi, she also does the Peria Tiru Antati and thus complete all the works of this poet saint par-excellence.",0

It wasn’t an easy journey; the director had written various scripts and bounced off ideas to filmmakers, without much success. Some of his projects got cancelled after coming close to taking off. Naturally, he is quite emotional as his film Middle Class Abbayi (MCA) starring Nani and Sai Pallavi releases this month. He talks of his producer Dil Raju, his core team and technicians who stood by him when there were initial hiccups as the project continued. He appears calm, composed and is brimming with positivity as he talks about his film. “Nani liked MCA instantly, he seemed to fit into it perfectly.You will be able to make out the difference from the rest of the roles he had done before.” Speaking about the inspiration to the film, Sreeram says, “The idea germinated when I moved to Hyderabad with my brother and when I got married. The story is from a purely personal experience. Rest of it is fiction. My brother is my hero and we were very close, stayed together in the city before my wife came into my life. I noticed the small and tiny insecurities in him and found it really cute. I selected a script which is not completely out of the box and also something that not many have worked on. It has a nice screenplay.” The trailer which released shows Nani moving to Warangal with his sister-in-law (Bhumika) who keeps harassing him with household chores.Bhumika Chawla returns to the big screen after a long time. Their relationship is sure to evoke laughter and will also bring in an element of seriousness. The director concurs, “If good content is complemented with a better casting, it will surely help the film. Bhumika was my first choice. I had to make her wait one entire day for only a single scene being shot on her, but she was so understanding.” He adds, “The conflict point in the film is simple, how we understand, misunderstand and misinterpret relations. Despite the egos and misunderstandings amongst family members, I tried not portraying it as a melodrama.” So is his brother aware of the plot? “My brother is clueless, he saw the trailer and remarked mana katha laga undi . I said, ‘Not really, wait till you watch the film’.” He terms Sai Pallavi as the best part and entertaining part of MCA . When he signed her, Fidaa had not released. He admits of getting tempted to make her speak Telangana again as the setting is in Warangal but he resisted it. Most of the films in recent times like Arjun Reddy, Fidaa and parts of Pelli Chupulu had the artistes talking in Telangana dialect, which is why the director chose to do away with it. The reason for choosing Warangal as a backdrop is for a visual difference, he says. It is a historical place with a unique texture — the rocks, the old buildings and most of the visuals haven’t been used in films. Also he is very familiar with its topography. He avers, “I wanted it to be shot in a town. There is a different kind of emotion that comes from a village and there is a different emotion from the city. One fights for bread, other for spaghetti. We wanted to capture the essence of those emotions.” Sreeram adds, “I am the story writer but I am assisted by two talented dialogue writers, Thiru and Sreekanth. It is a blessing to have Sameer Reddy handle the camera. We shot on roads and real locations and his experience helped me. Devi Sri Prasad had given all crowd-pleasing numbers and the lyrics are a reflection of my thought process, especially the first song.” The idea germinated when I moved to Hyderabad with my brother and when I got married.

The move is aimed at ensuring transparency and smooth conduct of the examinations. Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, said, “Under this initiative, answer books will carry photographs of the student as well as their UID number which they tend to fill up wrongly due to exam stress.” Till 2015, each examinee had to write her/his name, unique identification number (UID), and the name of the subject on the answer sheet booklets. From 2016, the answer sheet will have students’ photograph, name, UID, and name of the subject printed on it. The number of pages of the answer booklets will remain the same – 16 for ICSE and 20 for ISC. The portion of the top-sheet of a booklet that will bear the name and photograph will be torn off and retained by the council before the scripts are distributed for evaluation. This will be done to ensure confidentiality. Once the scripts are marked, the results will be prepared by matching the UIDs with the corresponding names in the council's database. The new system is aimed at preventing mistakes committed by students while writing their names and UIDs. The council will send the answer booklets of the students in separate packets. Each packet will have the photograph and other identity details of the student printed on it. Each sealed packet will contain the answer booklets of all subjects in which the particular student will take the examination. That means if a school has 150 ICSE examinees, it will receive as many packets containing answer booklets. Till 2015, the council used to send the answer sheets in bundles of up to 500 booklets each.

The beauty of Sanskrit lies in it being able to blend with any foreign language not to talk of its Indian derivatives. Rajeswari Sainath and troupe comprised the dance component to this presentation. The plus point first — excellent background music by B.V. Balasai with clarity oozing out of every musical instrument formed the backbone of Menaka. Dramatic tools like female sutradaar to mime and dance to the brilliant narration in English as well as Sanskrit (by Kalpana Kannabiran and Sagari R. Ramdas), the change in attire from the traditional dance costumes (though a little more care could have gone into the choice of fabric), the ingenuity of supplementing the male counterparts (who do not appear in person at all) through creative expression and dance dialogue- all these have gone into making the production rich in artistry. From a critical point of view: the Menaka episode in no way undermines the dignity of womanhood. The constant refrain of ‘violence’ articulated any number of times in the narrative, by the males in the three incidents portrayed did not find an echo in the characters of Menaka or Mamatha. To a certain extent, it was Shakuntala who could be seen as someone used and dumped in a predominantly male world of her times. But the principal protagonist Menaka, by no stretch of imagination, can be seen as a victim of male domination or neglect. Her character and role are clear and well delineated: to upset Vishwamitra’s penance and lure him into momentary thirst for lust. With that her assignment comes to an end. Further she is pronounced ‘celestial’ creature and so the norms of earth do not apply to her. Menaka goes one step above mortals in abandoning her infant in the woods and getting along with her ‘profession.’ So is the case with Rambha. The case of Mamatha and Brishaspati, is to be viewed as continuity of genealogy rather than seduction and abuse. How do we look at the concept of surrogate mothers now? The rest is for you to analyse. But can we apply twenty-first century norms to the Puranas? Asmita’s (run by Vasant Kannabiran, the author of the ballet) purpose may be creditable but in the end Menaka fails to impress. Rajeswari Sainath as Menaka, Vaishnavi Sainath as Shakuntala, Ashrita as Mamatha, Krithika as Rambha and Nainitha as the Sutradaarini were good. Footwork delineations to swara and pure music and pronounced jatis alternatively enhanced the choreography. In group movements as a whole, clarity and sync marked the well discernable patterns. N.S. Yamuna’s directorial abilities and Kaaraikkudi Mani’s choreographic expertise were very much to the fore.",0

Soon after, the commandos conducted a route march in some parts of the city as part of a confidence-building exercise, in the wake of a general alert following the Mumbai terror attacks. The commandos, who are undergoing a six-month-long training under senior police officers, are being tutored in using automatic weapons. Perhaps it is for the first time that a force trained in the basics of commando warfare is being used to give security cover, along with civil police, in the city. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) Jawaharhal told The Hindu that the force conducted a flag march in some parts of the city to build confidence among the public, who were in a state of shock over the terror attacks in Mumbai. The commandos would also conduct route marches in other parts of the city on Sunday and Monday, he added. Although the Chamundi Commando Force is not as elite as the “Black Cat” commandos, the police are training the commandos — all aged below 30 years — to handle emergencies. They are being groomed on the lines of National Security Guards (NSG) in counter-terrorism tactics. The force was formed during the recent Dasara celebrations, which had come under the terror radar. The festivities passed off peacefully, thanks to unprecedented security cover in the city. The Chamundi force will become fully operational to tackle any type of emergency once all its members receive counter-terrorism training and other requisite skills.",0

Megs, Sandhya and Rohan sat under the shade of the tree. There was no breeze. “Let's go down to the stream,” suggested Rohan. “At least the water will be cool.” At the stream was a a girl around their age. She smiled. “What are you doing here?” asked Megs. “I have come to see the dolphins!” she replied. “Dolphins! Dolphins!” they laughed. The girl was unfazed. When they finally stopped laughing she looked back at the river, and whistled. The water began to ripple and three beautiful, gleaming dolphins arched out of the water. “AAHHH!” exclaimed the three. The girl waved at the dolphins and spoke to them. The dolphins swam up to the banks and it looked like they were having a conversation. After a time they swam off. The girl walked away. Rohan tried a similar whistle but of course, nothing happened! “Come on,” said Megs, “let's catch up with her and find out how she brought the dolphins here!” They ran down the path they had seen her go. They caught up with her as she was entering a cottage. “Hey! Hello! Wait up!” She heard them and waited. “Listen, we are so sorry we laughed at you when you said you were waiting to see the dolphins. We had never ever seen dolphins there…” said Sandhya. The girl smiled and said, “Why don't you come inside?” They introduced themselves. “My name is Minu. Every summer, my dad and I go on a vacation. This year we chose this place!” Just then her father appeared. She introduced him as ‘Mr. K'! He wore very baggy trousers that were mended at the knees, a bright red shirt, and a shiny, velvet, black coat that hung down to his knees. He smiled and rubbed his hands in glee, seeing them. “So what can I get you children? I suggest some lovely herb tea. That's the best to beat the summer heat.” He disappeared into the kitchen. Very soon, he came traipsing out balancing a tray with three lovely thimble-sized cups — blue, green and red. “Now sip it very slowly. It is very potent and should be taken only in small quantities.” “What is your favourite book?” he asked. “Mine is Wizard of Oz ,” said Megs immediately. “I would say, my favourite is Moby Dick , but then I also like War Horse !” said Rohan. “Uh Ho! NO NO!,” protested Mr. K. “Only one book please.” “Okay then, I guess War Horse wins.” “Mine is definitely Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again !” said Sandhya. Suddenly, a great wind blew outside, howling against the cottage, rocking it and then everything seemed to disappear in the wind. Finally, after what seemed ages, when the wind died down they saw that they were in some unknown place. As they picked themselves up they saw a strange creature walking towards them. Every step he took he made a sound — very like the clanging of a tin can. Mr. K said, “You can sing ‘Somewhere over the rainbow…'. I'll join in the chorus.” Megs began to sing, “Somewhere…” But then Megs was not a good singer, and her voice jarred and scraped at every nerve in the listeners and they were forced to make her shut up. Mr. K thought it very funny and laughed. Minu was not amused. While Mr. K was still laughing they heard the sound of gun shots. They took cover under the sparse undergrowth. The gun shots and the sound of war came closer. They heard the steady clip-clop clip-clop of horse's hooves. When they peered out of the bushes they saw a beautiful horse. Majestic in his bearing and proudly carrying an English soldier. “Wow! I don't believe this,” said Rohan. “This is Joey!” The horse and rider came closer. Then all of a sudden he reared, throwing off the soldier and with nostrils flaring and his tail high in the air he charged towards where they were hiding. They ran as fast as they could, but the horse was gaining on them. They could almost feel his hot fetid breath on their backs. Just when they thought they had met their end they heard the sound of a car. They glanced upwards and saw a rather strange looking vehicle bearing down on them. As it came close, it seemed to stretch out a hand and gather them all up. Without even realising what had happened, they found themselves safely ensconced in the comfort of a car. “Hello,” said the man driving, “We are the Tootings. Join us for more adventure…” The Tooting family cheered and shouted hello and the car went up and down. Far below they could see mountains and valleys, rivers and the sea. Then Mr. K snapped his fingers and they were back in his little cottage. The girl sat there tight-lipped and unsmiling. Mr. K was cheerful and happy. “Can I get you some more herb tea?” he asked, mischief lighting up his eyes. “No father, you will not!” said the girl sternly. Megs, Rohan and Sandhya looked at her doubtfully. “My father is a magician! He does this to all the people I bring home. They never visit again!” “Oh! But I think we will visit again,” said Rohan. “And again,” said Sandhya. “And again,” said Megs. The girl smiled.",0

The reason ascribed for this is the drying up of cash reserves in banks owing to the dismal quantum of remittances against huge withdrawals by customers which is an impact of demonetisation, especially after the cap on cash withdrawals was lifted in mid March. The Telangana Grameena Bank (TGB) which tops the list of banks in terms of quantum of money disbursed as crop loans in Adilabad and neighbouring districts has not started loaning. Normally it starts advancing money to farmers at the beginning of April. The release of Rs. 6 crore from its bank chest on Monday was no consolation for the TGB Adilabad region because it meant that only about Rs. 8 lakh will be disbursed for each of its 72 branches. “Every branch has a target disbursal of Rs. 10 crore or Rs. 20 crore as crop loans and such amounts are of no help,” lamented an officer. According to bankers, further delay could have a disastrous consequences on agriculture sector. The district has a tentative crop loan target of Rs. 1,124 crore for the current financial year which is Rs. 282 crore more than last year’s target. No cash to replenish The phenomenon has also affected cash disposal through ATMs. Many of the ATMs in Adilabad and neighbouring districts have remained closed for days on end as cash could not be replenished in them. The pathetic situation of banks can be gauged from availability of cash in the local chest branch, the SBI Shivaji Chowk branch. Against a cash holding capacity of over Rs. 275 crore, the bank has not more than Rs. 10 crore on any given day since mid March. The bank receives only Rs. 40 lakh to Rs. 50 lakh every day by way of remittances from the RTC, Railways and petrol bunks and government deposits while the outflow of cash is to the tune of Rs. 2 crore, according to sources. The total outflow during the month-long period is in excess of Rs. 50 crore which constitutes a major chunk of the bank’s cash transaction lopsidedness. Similarly, the Telangana Grameena Bank, main branch which is a major crop loan disbursal unit in the town, has about Rs. 5 crore in cash as outflow. It pays Rs. 25 lakh per day to its customers while receives remittances to the tune of about Rs. 7 lakh, much of it from the self help groups. Stock cash at home “The demonetisation experience has bank customers stash cash at home rather than keep it in their accounts,” pointed out a senior banking official. “We are not able to replenish ATMs because of this and have restricted quantum of payments too,” he added on the current situation in all banks. Each branch of Telangana Grameena Bank gets Rs. 8 lakh for loan disbursal against Rs. 10 crore target. Bank official Telangana Grameena Bank",0

Agriculture is the primary occupation of a majority of people in this segment. The Mookambika temple, established by the exponent of Advaita Sankaracharya at Kollur, comes under this constituency. Tourist spots, such as the Marvanthe beach, which lies between the Arabian Sea and the Souparnika river, and the Othinane Nesara Dhama are in this constituency. A large number of naxalite-affected villages also come under this constituency. Byndoor is regarded as a backward area among the five Assembly seats in the district. This constituency is the largest in the district with 65 villages, including 10 villages drawn from Kundapur constituency during the delimitation. This Assembly segment has now become part of Shimoga parliamentary constituency, after delimitation, much to the discomfort of the people here. There are 1,66,360 voters in the constituency. Of them 90,528 are women and 75,832 men. The Congress candidate, K. Gopal Poojary, had defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate, K. Lakshminarayana, by a margin of 3,252 votes in the 2004 elections, and by 5,382 votes in the 1999 elections. Mr. Poojary had earlier defeated Mr. Lakshminarayana in the Assembly by-polls of June 1998. It will be the fourth clash between old rivals. Mr. Poojary is banking on the development work taken up by him in the constituency. However, the inclusion of 10 villages to the Byndoor constituency is said to be advantageous to the BJP. U. Das Bhandary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Shiriyar Muddanna Shetty of the Janata Dal (S) and Uday Kumar Tallur of the Bahujan Samaj Party are also in the fray.",0

Gouridasan Nair Time for serious introspection The ruling alliance retained the seat by the skin of its teeth In the May elections, LDF had won by a margin of 5,000 votes THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As expected, Thiruvambadi proved to be a tough call for the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF). The ruling alliance retained the seat by the skin of its teeth, something that should make LDF managers sit up and take note of. For only six months ago, it had won the seat by an impressive margin of over 5,000 votes. The State has not seen any major realignment of political forces since the last election and the only visible change in Kerala's political landscape had happened in favour of the LDF - the decision of K. Karunakaran and his supporters, now part of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), to throw their lot with the LDF. The Jama-at-e-Islami and People's Democratic Party (PDP) are still very much with the LDF. So is the Sunni Muslim faction led by Kanthapuram A. P. Abubacker Musaliar. Generating sympathy The untimely death of Mathai Chacko, who had wrested the seat from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in the May election, had generated enough of a sympathy for the LDF in the constituency and the Saddam Hussein factor was at play precisely at the time when the election campaign was picking. If the LDF could not repeat the kind of victory it had scored in the May Assembly election despite all these propitious ingredients, the alliance would have to look elsewhere for its reasons. One basic factor that could have worked against the LDF is the fact Thiruvambadi is a traditional UDF stronghold. Mathai Chacko could wrest it mainly for three reasons other than the political and organisational backing the LDF received across the State. The first was the massive pro-LDF wave that swept the UDF to political margins in May. The second was the IUML decision to import M. C. Mayin Haji, facing serious charges in connection with the Marad incidents, as its candidate in Thiruvambadi. The third was the personal charisma that Mathai Chacko had among the settler population in the constituency. This time round, the UDF took remedial measures on all these fronts. It found a local candidate in V. K. Ummer Master to take on LDF's George M. Thomas and put up a strong fight to wrest the seat back. Had they succeeded in securing another 125 votes, the result would have been different. The message of the Thiruvambadi by-election could be that the State's electoral politics is back to square one, where the two alliances can fight bitter battles and swing matters their different way with a little help from here and there. Since the political factors remained the same or was marginally in favour of the LDF after the reinforced NCP offering it full support, the LDF leadership would have to find an answer for the question why it could not take its tally upward. There is another difficulty for the LDF. If it takes that it did benefit from the support extended to it by K. Karunakaran and his supporters, it would imply that it would have lost the election if the political equations had remained the same as in May. That would amount to an admission that the LDF could not raise its campaign pitch to the level that obtained in the State and the constituency in May. That would be trickier than saying that the Karunakaran factor had no impact in the constituency.",0

According to recent reports, the Bill aims to establish a regulatory authority for enforcing fair practices and accountability norms and fast track dispute resolution mechanism in real estate transactions. If the bill is framed right, this could change the face of real estate in India and bring in the much needed reforms in the industry. The Bill is a very good opportunity for the government to give some structure to the currently ‘unorganised real estate sector.’ The government should take an unbiased approach towards this bill which would benefit the industry and its stakeholders – customers, developers, bankers etc. The Government’s proposed initiative to fast track approvals by putting up the status online will bring in the much-needed transparency and accountability to projects. The real estate sector is definitely a high growth area for the country. The focus should be on providing the right quality of living to everyone. At present builders are taking the initiative to provide quality and environment-friendly living spaces. Although I don’t personally believe in over-regulation because rules can be bent, I believe that there is a need to structure the industry to ensure consistent quality. This change has to come from within the industry rather than over-regulation. Incentivising may be the best way to go forward. The Bill should help drive up consumer confidence.

Though meant for providing last mile connectivity, they are operating on several arterial roads including those in the Lutyens’ zone. With no legal backing available till date, the traffic police is also finding it hard to rein in these vehicles. The police on Thursday removed around a dozen battery-rickshaws from near Dr. Rajendra Prasad Road-Janpath crossing as the operators have been parking their vehicles on the road itself. A makeshift mechanic shop had also started operating next to a temple on the pavement adjoining Mati Ghar here. “Despite being served several warnings, the battery rickshaw owners park their vehicles on the road, causing inconvenience to other commuters,” said a traffic police officer overseeing the exercise at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Road. While the Transport Department had issued notice in March asking e-rickshaw owners to get vehicle type approvals from government-approved institutes, the department is still in the process of formulating a policy on registering them and defining the routes where they could be allowed to operate. The Transport Department had also instructed e-rickshaw dealers to get trade licences and dealerships issued in their names within three months. Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Secretary S.N. Srivastava convened a meeting with officials from the Transport Department and the Delhi Traffic Police to decide on the government’s position on the battery-rickshaws. Sources said while there has been a consensus among the different agencies about reining in these vehicles on the city roads, Mr. Srivastava instructed the officials to formulate a policy. “The officials were instructed to rope in expert bodies in the field of transport and traffic for formulating the policy at the earliest,” said a senior Transport Department official.

Sridevi Sai via Email, Chittoor Mathematics has proved to be a nemesis to many. But it has impacted people in every segment of life. Mathematics is one of the oldest and most fundamental of sciences. Mathematicians use mathematical theory, computational techniques, algorithms and the latest computer technology to solve economic, scientific, engineering, physics and business problems. Their work falls into two broad classes — theoretical (pure) mathematics and applied mathematics. Professionals often are a part of an interdisciplinary team that may include economists, engineers, computer scientists, physicists, technicians and others. Deadlines, overtime work, special requests for information or analysis, and prolonged travel to attend seminars or conferences may be part of their job. Mathematicians who work in academia usually have a mix of teaching and research responsibilities. Manufacturing: Dimensional tolerance, digital pre-assembly and nominal components. Modelling of manufacturing systems, reactive ion etching, and thermal processes. Pattern placement and throughput in electron beam technology. Process optimisation (reducing time to market). Product design: Shape optimisation Simulation of functionality. Materials: Predicting damage and degradation of polymers. Non-destructive testing. Simulation of material properties.

Cases have been registered against seven persons, including a zilla panchayat member. When the body of Prakash was brought to Ramanathapura on Sunday, there was tension in the area. Relatives of the victim demanded that the accused be arrested and refused to cremate the body until then. Police resorted to mild lathi-charge and the body was taken to Jittenahalli. The body was cremated on Monday evening after the arrival of Hassan District Congress president A. Manju. The victim's relatives wanted to cremate the body in Ramanathapura but police insisted on having the cremation in Jittenahalli. As a precaution, the weekly market on Monday was cancelled in Ramanathapura. Speaking to The Hindu in Hassan on Tuesday, Additional Superintendent of Police Thammaiah said Prakash, a resident of Jittenahalli in Arakalagudu taluk, died in a private hospital in Hassan on Sunday from poisoning. His wife Nagaratna lodged a complaint with the police and told them she suspected seven persons who were harassing her husband for repayment of a loan. On April 19, the accused reportedly assaulted Prakash and forced him to drink liquor that was allegedly mixed with poison. Mr. Thammaiah said case has been registered against zilla panchayat member Shankar, his wife Jayanthi, Shamiyana Manju, Ravi, Auto Rajanna and Mohan.",0

Avesthagen Limited, working in the field of predictive and preventive personalised health care, has selected the 69,000-strong Zoroastrian community for the unique project in view of its uniform genome and well-documented ancestry and medical history. “Generations of marital and sexual relations confined within the small community have led to emergence of positive traits as well as occurrence of certain inherited diseases among Zoroastrians. The project will try to identify drug targets by understanding the genetic structure of this rare population,” said Avesthagen vice-president Anil Chauhan here. Mr. Chauhan, who was in Jaipur in connection with a dance theatre performance on Zoroastrians, said their small population with a wealth of genetic, disease and genealogical information was a “scarce resource” in human genetics. Avesthagen has collected blood samples of about 3,000 Zoroastrians, settled mainly in Maharashtra and Gujarat, as part of the study. According to Mr. Chauhan, the project would initially focus on two neurological and two cancer conditions and would finally unravel the genetic basis of longevity of Zoroastrians. The dance theatre performance, “And they came to India”, presented by Mallika Sarabhai and her troupe at Ravindra Manch here this past Sunday, traced the early Persians and their myths and the birth of Zoroastrianism in Iran and the migration of Zoroastrians – popularly called Parsis – to India.",0

In a way, it is. This car has a new face, a new engine and a new price. When it is launched this month, it will be diving into a segment that has the Maruti Swift Dzire and the maxi-space Mahindra Logan. Redesigned The bumper is redesigned, the headlamps and grille are new, and the hood is different too. Look at it from the rear, and it’s like meeting an old friend who’s wearing new glasses. You know something is different, but it’s hard to put a finger on it. That’s because the only changes at the back are the slightly redesigned tail-lamps. Under the hood lies the biggest change. Ford has slipped the 1.4-litre TDCi engine from the Fiesta into the Ikon. The interiors will give Ikon fans a sense of déjÀ vu. Here, the only changes are the new dials and the beige colour scheme. From the driver’s seat, there’s good visibility outside. The driving position is comfortable – the chunky steering is a nice fit in your palms, the seat is well bolstered, and there’s good thigh support (if only the seat base was a bit longer, it would be perfect). Twist the key, and you’ll be greeted with a gravelly idle note. There’s a bit of vibration through the gear lever too. Ford claims a big improvement in NVH (noise, vibration and harshness), but in reality, it isn’t much. You can hear the gravelly engine note at all times, even while cruising. On the highway you will feel a bit short on power, but the car will happily cruise at 120 kph. At this speed, the engine is spinning at a frenetic 3000 rpm, so it is audible in the cabin. Ford has tweaked the suspension settings. The ride is really good, the Ikon absorbing bumps with a nicely rounded edge and the suspension is very refined. Ford is offering only one variant on the Ikon. If Ford can price it at Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 6 lakh, the Ikon would make a lot of sense. It is very driveable in city traffic and is ‘middle-of-the-road’ in the ride department. It handles well, still looks the most proportionate car in this class, and now comes with an engine that’s proven its fuel efficiency. OUSEPH CHACKO",0

Subramaniam, at Kovai Medical Center and Hospital (KMCH) here. While stent grafting, which involves a tube covered with fabric being placed in aorta through a small incision, is used to treat such aneurysms, KMCH doctors said that such a procedure would not have worked in this case as it would have blocked his stomachs’ blood vessels from connecting to intestines and other organs. Addressing a press conference on Monday, Chief of Interventional Radiology Mathew Cherian said the hospital decided to make the holes in the stent themselves, for which the diameter of the connecting blood vessel was calculated using a detailed CT (computed tomography) scan. Known as ‘fenestrated stent grafting,’ this procedure entailed precisely placing small stent grafts inside the main graft stent. Two small holes were made in the main graft stent using a high-precision soldering device by the hospital staff. Micro stitching was done around the edges of the two small holes - where the small stents were placed - in the main stent to ensure that the hole did not tear wide open during the procedure or at a later stage. This stitching also made sure that the holes show up in x-ray scans. Once the main stent was placed, the small stents were connected with the branching blood vessel using small tubes inserted into the aorta. The 10-hour “life-saving non surgical repair of abdominal aneurysm” was performed by a team that included Dr. Cherian, vascular surgeon M. Bhuvaneswaran and interventional radiologist Pankaj Mehta. Dr. Bhuvaneswaran said that performing an open surgery would have taken three days and involved operations in the stomach and heart. Besides, there would have been significant probability of infections at a later stage. In Mr. Subramaniam’s case, he was out of ICU in a day. Hospital Chairman Nalla G. Palaniswami said that while stents with such holes were available, they alone cost around Rs. 25 lakh and were made mostly in the U.S. The hospital charged Rs. 15 lakh for the entire procedure. He said very few centres in the country have done this procedure.",0

She was speaking to reporters in the aftermath of the collision on Wednesday between a van carrying schoolchildren and a private bus at Trasi village that resulted in the death of eight children. After visiting the injured children at the Kasturba Hospital here, she said concerted action by various departments – including police, regional transport and school heads – was needed to prevent such tragedies. As many as 117 children had lost their lives in road accidents in the State from 2014 to 2016. The police department should appoint a constable near schools to regulate and monitor the transport. Since over-speeding is a major reason for accidents, police and the Regional Transport Office should seize licences of drivers and vehicles in such cases. It is necessary to instal speed governors in private buses. Since low visibility is being blamed for the accident at Torvi, it is necessary that school vans have yellow lights on top so that it is well identified. There are clear guidelines for schools buses.

Dr. Dronamraju, who was advisor to the U.S. Government on health during former President Bill Clinton’s tenure, said while the exploitation had been on for centuries, the developed countries were modifying and giving it a new shape in the guise of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) and Multinational Corporations (MNCs). “The purpose is to transfer biodiversity from the poor to rich countries. They are transferring gene pools from Basmati rice and wheat of Punjab through hybrid technologies”, Dr. Dronamraju added. Conduits Talking to The Hindu here on Friday, he pointed out that India and many other developing countries possessed “rich biodiversity”. One could find thousands of species in a sq. hectare here as against 50 to 100 species within a similar area in U.K. or U.S.A. He said international organisations which appear to be “reputed and benign” could be conduits for bio-resources. The Indian authorities need to be extremely cautious while holding IPR negotiations on biodiversity. There was a link between biotechnology, biodiversity and IPR. The germplasm resources of major crops and medicinal plants in India were under a constant threat of exploitation. Huge diversity Stating that India probably had the highest diversity of medicinal plants to treat various types of cancer, hypertension, heart ailments and arthritis, he said the existing laws were not enough and new laws were needed to safeguard the country’s biodiversity. Apart from enforcing the statute, there should be strict controls along the borders as also constant patrolling of the entire coastline.

Kodandaram demanded the Andhra Pradesh government that it should withdraw cases registered against the students of Osmania University in the past one year. He alleged that the government was trying to keep the students in jail. “The elected representatives from Telangana have no moral right to take oath as Ministers in the new Cabinet that will be formed tomorrow as long as the students are languishing in jails. The posts they are ready to enjoy are because of the agitation by students,” he told a media conference at Sangareddy on Tuesday night. Stating that the Telangana agitation had spread to the nook and corner of the region because of the fast taken up by TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao last year, Mr. Kodandaram said that change of guard in the government would not help in stalling the ongoing agitation for separate State. “Many of the cases registered against students like Raja Ram, Errolla Srinivas and others are false. How can each student commit more than 60 to 70 crimes in a matter of eight to ten days? Moreover, all the cases are the same which even Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram gave assurance to withdraw,” he said. The demand made by students to amend 14 (F) clause and conduct the SI examinations was nothing new but one which was supported by all political parties.

Living away from families in high altitudes and harsh climes are some of the reasons cited as is the fact that there is more money in the corporate world.

Following High Court’s order and subsequent orders from local chief judicial magistrate (CJM), the TI parade was scheduled to be held at Choudwar circle jail here on Saturday. Suspects Accordingly, all the nine arrested persons in the case were brought from Baliguda sub-jail in Kandhamal to Choudwar jail earlier in the morning under tight security.

Ask comedians Sahil Khattar and Ayushman Gupta, currently facing trouble over “objectionable” content on their YouTube channel Being Indian. The two counter that they do not attempt to mock a certain personality or social structure. Ayushman says, “We follow a simple strategy. Laugh with us, Laugh at us.” Pointing out the content of one of his videos, Ayushman says, ‘Every Bengali mom in the world’ was not an attempt to mock his mother. “The idea was to laugh at her and laugh with her. There are so many stereotypes about people and cultures. It’s not about breaking stereotypes but about embracing them. You have to accept stereotypes; only then will you be able to break them.” Sahil says their observational comedy does not offend any sect or person, and their humour is more sharp and quirky than punchy or intelligent. He says content creation is a long process. The duo says its priority is not only marketable content, but creating subject matter that would initiate a dialogue. What follows is serious brainstorming and experimentation with the content and presentation, which would serve as benchmarks. Sahil and Ayushman’s popularity was evident when they were nominated to participate in Sprite Comedy Konkout by The Tenderloins. Ayushman says their work begins with observing trending stuff on the Internet — everything related to lifestyle. After this, a comprehensive ground research starts, to decide on the marketability and understanding of the content. Dismissing claims of being vulnerable, Sahil asserts that they are confident of producing new content and are not afraid of the expectation of their viewers. Of late, the Internet seems to have lost its credibility of being the ideal platform for projecting a balanced debate. But, interestingly, the channel claims to find more freedom on the Internet than any other platform. Sahil believes that the Internet serves his motive of initiating an unbiased real-life dialogue. “The idea is to start a dialogue and not to take sides…. The kind of dialogue that I wanted to start is what I found on the Internet,” says Sahil. On the future of comedy, specifically YouTube comedy, Ayushman says, “As long as things do not go right in the world, there would be a few who would want to dissent and raise their voice.” While Ayushman sees humour as a form of protest, with scope for sensibility and expression, Sahil feels that humour wouldn’t harm anyone.” You have to accept stereotypes; only then will you be able to break them",0

167,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/lsquoCall-me-GNBrsquo/article15401178.ece,features,fridayreview,‘Call me GNB’,"SRIRAM VENKATKRISHNAN Most of his knowledge had been acquired by listening intently to music, assimilating it and later making it his own. It was said of him that letters simply addressed as “GNB, Madras” would make their way to his residence, such being his star status. And considering that he frequently shifted home, this was no mean task. The Prince Charming of Carnatic Music, G.N. Balasubramaniam, GNB to fans and friends, both of which were legion, presided over the annual conference of the Music Academy in 1958, exactly fifty years ago. On January 1, 1959, the birudu and insignia of Sangita Kalanidhi was conferred on him and as befitting his stature “a large and distinguished gathering of musicians and music lovers was present at the P.S. High School pandal, where the function was held and cheered GNB” (The Hindu, January 2, 1959). It must be remembered here that the Academys’s present auditorium was still being built. Guru-sishya relationship The Governor of Kerala, Dr. B Ramakrishna Rao presided over the event and in his speech “stressed the value of guru-sishya relationship and said that the lack of that personal relationship between the teacher and the taught was responsible for the calamitous things that that had happened in the field of general education.” It was rather ironic that the Governor chose guru-sishya relationship as the theme of his talk, for GNB was rather unique in that respect. Barring his initial learning under his father G.V. Narayanaswami Iyer, some further training under Madurai Subramania Iyer and still later a couple years under Tiger Varadachariar, GNB hardly had any guru to speak of. Most of his knowledge had been acquired by listening intently to music, assimilating it and later making it his own, giving it his unique stamp by means of his great intellect. New phenomenon His briga based music was a new phenomenon in the world of Carnatic Music. In fact, the citation mentioned that with “a unique style of his own and a speedy virtuosity of voice he gained a large popularity and a school of followers and pupils.” Of course, not everyone felt comfortable with his music and some detractors even went to extent of calling it ‘English Sangeetham,’ owing to GNB possessing a BA (Hons) degree in English literature. It is interesting to read that the Academy’s sadas began on that day with a prayer sung by KV Narayanaswami, then a rising star. It must have made up somewhat for the absence of KVN’s guru, Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar who was in those years not accepting any concert opportunities at the Music Academy. GNB must have missed Ariyakkudi keenly, for to him Ariyakkudi was the very embodiment of music. Among the vidwans assembled on the occasion, mention must be made of GNB’s close friends, T Chowdiah and Palani Subramania Pillai. Both spoke on the occasion and Palani in his speech complimented GNB for the way in which he conducted the Academy’s annual conference that year. Madurai Mani Iyer too was present and said “that he was very happy that his friend GNB was honoured on the occasion. Whenever GNB and he met, they would be speaking for hours on the intricacies of music. The music of GNB was noted for its verve.” GNB was still a relative youngster and there were seniors present as well. Among them, Tiruvizhimizhalai Subramania Pillai (the first nagaswaram artist to be conferred the title of Sangita Kalanidhi) and Annasami Bhagavatar, the Harikatha exponent, spoke. In his acceptance speech, GNB said that he owed his present position to “his father, Tiger Varadachariar and Sri Ramanuja Iyengar.” He must have remembered the early days when Ariyakkudi was a frequent visitor at home. That was a period when GNB’s speed of singing had worried his father no end and he had consulted Ariyakkudi about it. The latter had said that a natural voice should never be tampered with and had encouraged GNB to sing the way he felt best. GNB had always prided himself on being an “Academy boy” for he had performed along with Tiger Varadachariar as early as 1932 when the Teachers College of Music was begun by the Academy. His speech therefore also paid tributes to the institution. He said that “The Expert Committee of the Music Academy was an august body and he had not had the courage to reject the offer of Presidentship of the conference.” He said that “art was big and an artist was a mere dwarf before a giant”. Unknowingly or perhaps otherwise, GNB had also sparked off another revolution in Carnatic music, albeit a minor one. With him, the trend of referring to musicians by initials and not by village name began and his were perhaps the most famous initials among them all. And so he wound his speech up with the request that “the musically minded public would continue to call him “GNB””! (The author can be contacted at >srirambts@gmail.com)",0

Although scholars in Jainism in Tamil Nadu know the existence of bas-relief sculptures of tirthankaras and Tamil Vattellutu inscriptions on the Samanamalai, both datable to 9th-10th century CE, what has surprised them is the recent discovery of the Tamil-Brahmi script on a boulder on the hill's terrace. The script is engraved on the boulder in which a drip-ledge has been cut and beds excavated on the rock floor for the Jaina monks to rest. V. Vedachalam, former Senior Epigraphist, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department, and V. Muthukumar, research scholar from Tamil University, Thanjavur, discovered this inscription. The script, which is datable to second century BCE, has 13 letters. Iravatham Mahadevan, a scholar in Tamil-Brahmi script, called it “a good discovery of genuine importance” and said he was “surprised that it has been overlooked for such a long time.” Different interpretations of the newly found script have been given by specialists in Tamil-Brahmi. Mr. Mahadevan, who read it as “Peru Thorur Kunra Ko Ayam,” said it recorded the gift of a mountain pool/spring by the chief of the hill at a place called Peru Thorur. He said: “It is clearly an inscription with Jaina affinity because you can see the drip line cut above the inscription, which is carved on the brow of the rock. The letters are very archaic and they are tall and narrow. They belong to the Mankulam and Arittapatti [both situated near Madurai] style of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions. The archaic nature of the Samanamalai script can be seen from the spelling of the word ‘ayam,' which means a mountain pool of water or spring.” Dr. Y. Subbarayalu, Head, Indology, French Institute of Pondicherry, and Dr. Vedachalam have read it as “Peru Tho Ur Uzhithegne Ayam.” According to Dr. Subbarayalu, the word “ayam”, besides occurring at Samanamalai, had been used in the Tamil-Brahmi inscription at Mudalaikulam, about 10 km to the west of Samanamalai. “We can call ‘ayam' a spring or a cave. The Mudalaikulam inscription uses the word ‘Perayam', which means a big tank. There is more of a possibility to call it a cave,” Dr. Subbarayalu said. There were chances of obtaining different readings for the Samanamalai script. For instance, “The Ur” could be read as “Tho Ur.” The word “Uzhithegne” could be a personal name, he added. In Dr. Vedachalam's interpretation, the script refers to an “ayam” dug by a man called Uzhithegne of Perunthevur. Specialists had argued that the word meant a water tank (“Kulam” in Tamil). “Ayam” could also mean a “crater” (“pallam”). A water tank did not fit into the context of where Jaina monks stayed, the Senior Epigraphist said. So “ayam,” in the Samanamalai context, could refer to the drip-ledge cut on the rock's brow or the beds cut on the floor. Thus the word “ayam” established that it was a place where the Jaina monks stayed, Dr. Vedachalam said. “Perunthevur” could have existed near where the inscription had been found. Both “Uzhithegneyan,” the name of a person, and “Thevur”, the name of a village, belonged to the Tamil Sangam age. Dr. C. Santhalingam, former Archaeological Officer, Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology, called it “a remarkable discovery which pushes back the association of Jainism with this hill to more than 2,200 years.” He read it as “Peru Te Rur Kuzhiththai Ayam,” which meant these rock beds were carved by the villagers of Peru Therur. The word “Therur” could be read as “Thenur” because the fourth letter in the script looked like the dental “nu”. Thenur, now located near Sholavandan in Madurai district, found mention in the Sangam texts, Dr. Santhalingam said. Kuzhiththai meant dug out or excavated. Ayam meant rock shelter or bed. Ayam was the corrupt form of “ayanam” or “sayanam.”",0

She speaks in phrases made around it: Recognition has made us smile more. Smile is a common trait among EZVians (her staff), that smile is carried to all schools we work with. Smile is infectious! That’s Chitra Ravi for you. Founder-CEO, EZVidya, the person behind the “smile” has performed classical dance on stage, modelled and was indeed offered movie roles. Well, movies were an attractive, extended expression of what she was doing, but “I successfully stayed away. I guess I'm too impatient to spend hours in front of the camera,” she smiles. She happened to see a Computer Science textbook. The bubble on its cover picture screamed: “This computer is so fast, I am not!” Do kids have to be fast and accurate like computers, she thought in dismay. And vowed to change the system that would morph kids into mindless desktops. That was 11 years ago. The ‘system overhaul’ wasn't going to be easy. But she had a Masters in English, an MBA, and brimming zeal. She had seen her children’s less-than-happy experience in school. Yes, she would equip herself to promote a form of education that would let children ‘blossom.’ Bidding goodbye to her family business, she gathered a small education-passionate group and floated EZVidya. A tad ironical, if you read ‘EZ’ as ‘easy.’ Chitra’s premise: Education today does not encourage children to think. It's not nerdy or uncool to think! “Happy thinking” is possible and through it, children will learn to ‘look deep’ for critical/analytical thinking, ‘look beyond’ for creative ideas, ‘look around’ for social/environmental happenings (transportation, photo-synthesis) and ‘look within’ to reflect. Children should ask: Why am I learning this? What is the significance? And find answers. “I don't tell teachers what to do,” she says. “I ask questions, get them to think.” Are we showing the children the soul of the subject, say Chemistry? “Education must combine cognitive and affective aspects of learning,” she says. “It must aid self-discovery. The process can be triggered through lessons in class.” And children should learn to be emotionally safe. EZVidya builds tools to help teachers connect with students of today, and perfect the teacher-student relationship. They let students discover their unique talents, not fit them into a pre-determined frame-work. The package for schools includes teacher training, technology and aesthetically brought out materials. “Our Chrysalis textbooks are designed to create a 21st Century learning environment. They aim to build skills essential for ‘Living Well.’ It's an LKG- Class 5 curriculum, prepared in-house.” Her Techmate platform gives teachers classroom management widgets. It is simple PDF, interactive, and can be projected. There is also voiced poetry. “We are trying new methods using the mobile, which everyone is familiar with,” she said. Feedback has been good, she says. Some have called them true CCE tools. “Schools have told us that children they thought dull were the most participative when our materials are used. With Chrysalis, there's no need for persuasion. Our books/materials cater to the multiple intelligences of the children, allow space for expression. It’s time for our dull books to move over.” She and her 130-strong staff see EZVidya as a movement. Each feels he’s a contributing member. They meet students and teachers, get parents to participate actively and train teachers to listen sharply. We innovate constantly, re-visit goals, remain dynamic and robust, she says. “We look at the heart of education.” In the middle of all this, Chitra tweets actively, visits schools across India and abroad, attends national/international educational forums. And miraculously manages time for family, reading, music and friends. It is a long haul, but Chitra is optimistic. EZ Vidya works with over 400 schools across India, and partners several organisations including Wipro, Nokia, Dell, IBM, American India Foundation and the Azim Premji Foundation, in their educational initiatives. And the BridgeIT Award the company won recently, she says, “is a shot in the arm for people on a mission, especially one that seems to be on a road less travelled!” GEETA PADMANABHAN",0
172,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/your-pamper-routine/article8627086.ece,features,metroplus,Your pamper routine,"With the weather changing as it is (you can call it monsoons; I call it global warming a.k.a doom), I’m sure I’m not the only one who is suffering with unhappy hair and skin. One second, it’s humid, and the next, rain is everywhere, and it’s all wonderful and cool. But your skin doesn't seem to think so. Here are some easy ways to calm yourself, your skin and your hair... a Sunday at home pamper routine if you will. Tackle that skin Honey is everything. Be it skin or hair, it’s a wonder product. I love using honey on any areas that are getting heat boils or even blemishes. Since it’s anti-bacterial, keeping it on for 15 to 30 minutes calms your skin down. It also helps sooth those itchy patches caused by constant sun exposure. Another wonder product is sugar or sea salt. Use it as a scrub, especially on those blackheads, and around the nose and chin where your skin tends to clog up most. Lastly, always moisturise. No matter what, keep your skin hydrated. If a store-bought moisturiser isn’t for you, try aloe vera or almond oil (or a combination of them). Keep makeup light This is a general rule for summer, but keeping your makeup light around the year will also ensure it looks very natural. And if you ever run out of time and walk out of the house bare-faced, there won’t be too much of a difference. Over moisturiser, I like to spot-conceal. This basically implies that you use a tiny amount of concealer over places that really need it (under the eyes, scarring, pigmentation, blemishes etc) and pat it in with a clean finger. I like to go over it with a loose powder or a loose powder foundation, but apply it using a wet sponge. This, once again helps the powder sink into the skin and look natural. It also allows your bare skin to breathe and still look like itself. This way, be it sweating buckets or having buckets of water being poured down your face, your makeup will not give you away. Hair nourishment I always find that hair tends to get frizzy during this time of year, no matter what a person does. You can use all the conditioner you want, but unless your hair has been treated, chances are, this weather will cause it to frizz. A simple solution to this? Argan oil. There are so many products (more often priced ridiculously) where argan oil is the main ingredient. Instead of spending your money on them, I would suggest getting pure cold-pressed argan oil (www.mokshalifestyle.com). This oil is so nourishing and moisturising that a little bit (not more than a couple of drops) can tame the frizziest of hair. I love using this when my hair is damp and then let it air-dry, but make sure you don’t go overboard, or you will end up with hair that looks oily... and we don’t want that. An added bonus? It makes a wonderfully nourishing night-time moisturiser for your skin.",0

Noting that it was the seventh ""encounter"" death in Malnad region, they demanded that the guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission be followed and cases registered against the police who carried out the operation.

Will ‘Sivaji,’ starring Rajnikanth, prove to be yet another feather in his cap? Right from his debut film, ‘Gentleman,’ the creations churned out by director Shankar’s dream factory are meant to storm box-offices as they are entertainment extravaganzas that appeal to the masses. His movies are commercial masalas, with larger than life characters and a message-oriented, sugar-coated story. Shankar makes expensive films and uses state-of-the-art techniques that appeal to the youth. All this has made him the ‘baron’ of the box-office, as he has never tasted failure. Now the spotlight is on Shankar once again as he is teamed up with the superstar of the industry, Rajnikanth. High expectations Sitting in his aesthetically done up new office in T.Nagar, Chennai, Shankar says: “A lot is riding on ‘Sivaji,’ as it is my first film with superstar Rajnikanth. The expectations are high, because the audience expects a certain kind of film from us. We decided to take a middle path — the story has to move forward keeping the star’s image in mind.” For Shankar it was the biggest challenge in his life, as the mix had to be right. Says Shankar: “ ‘Sivaji’ is basically a very simple story about a man who wants to do something good for the society, which is steeped in corruption. Our man cleans the system in his own way. There is also a very relevant message.” The director says that his films are issue-related fantasies and in ‘Sivaji’ he has packaged it with all ingredients that one associates with a Rajnikanth masala entertainer — punch lines, comedy, romance, dream songs, huge sets, sentiment, powerful villain, fights and finally good triumphing over evil. Adds Shankar: “We cannot ignore the image of Rajnikanth and do a film with him. ‘Sivaji’ Sivaji is a well-balanced concoction of this image, heroism and the narration. In fact during the dubbing of the film, Rajni used to say that it is going to be a super hit and AVM Saravanan, the producer after seeing the final copy, told me that they are very happy with it.” The highlight of any Shankar film is the music and the picturisation of songs. In fact the ‘mind-blowing’ song sequences and the breathtaking sets were so impressive that Abirami Ramanathan paid a whopping Rs 6.5 crores for the Chennai city rights. Shankar says that he and Rahman sat together for days working out the tunes. Adds Shankar: “There are five songs in the film and all of them have turned out to be chartbusters. I think our combination ( Rahman-Shankar-Rajnikanth) has clicked as I’m told that the combined sales of ‘Sivaji’ albums in Tamil and Telugu have created a new all India record, even before the release of the film!.” The talkie portion of the film took only 65 days to shoot, while the songs and fight scenes were choreographed in about 160 days! Shankar is all praise for his team of actors such as Shriya, Suman and Vivek and technicians, cinematographer K.V.Anand, art director Thotta Tharani, editor Antony, action choreographer Peter Haynes and costume designer Manish Malhotra. Says Prabhu Deva, who has choreographed the hit number ‘Style…’ in the film: “We shot the song against the backdrop of Spain’s great architectural wonders, something nobody has done before. I made Rajni and Shriya do difficult steps and the whole song has been enriched by some awesome computer graphics. People are going to go crazy about it.” Shankar signs off by saying: “A lot of hard work straight from the heart has gone into ‘Sivaji.’ There will be a repeat audience for the film which has no blood or gore in it, it is a family entertainer for which the censors has given me a clean ‘U’ certificate. What more can I ask for?”",0

Workshop Addressing a workshop on RTI Act for the officers of cooperation department at Madhusudan Institute of Cooperative Management (MICM), Mr. Padhi said since inception 70 per cent cases received by the Commission would be on personal queries. People should come forward asking public interest cases such as how much fund had gone into social forestry, how many teachers were present in schools or how many times roads were developed, he said. The CIC said repeated questions on larger issues would help bring a change in overall function of administration. “To encourage public interest queries, Orissa Information Commission has categorised cases into several categories for dealing them on priority basis.

There was no Team Anna now, she said, as its erstwhile members were now speaking against each other. She pointed out that the document, on the basis of which they were making their allegations, was only a “primary draft” of a CAG report: “Comptroller and Auditor-General Vinod Rai had also said that quoting from the draft could be misleading and erroneous.” Challenging Team Anna members to go to court if they had proof, Ms. Soni said: “If they have some points to make, they should take recourse to the law of the land,” not merely make public allegations. Ms. Soni, however, made it clear that her criticism “in no way reduces, demolishes or minimises the importance of eradicating corruption in our country.” Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna said on Thursday that he would write to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to reject all the “motivated allegations” made against him by Team Anna. He, however, remained non-committal on the possibility of his filing a defamation suit against the team, saying he reserved the right to react in an appropriate manner if anybody made personal allegations against him. He was responding to charges that during his tenure as Karnataka Chief Minister he had de-reserved five forest blocks spread over 10,000 hectares for mining by private companies against the suggestions of the State Forest Secretary and Forest Minister. “It is highly improper for the members of Team Anna to accuse me of something that is untrue,” he said, adding: “The matter is before the Supreme Court and the truth will come out soon.”",0

Not all World Cuppers are fortunate to earn name and fame! For, not many know that Abid Ali, now 73 and more popularly known in Hyderabad cricketing circles as ‘Chichha’, was one of the couple of Indian players who can recall their experience of playing in the inaugural World Cup in 1975 in England with a sense of pride. One of his memorable outings was against New Zealand when he scored 70 and then claimed two for 35. The only other Indian to score a half-century was the great Gundappa Visvanath (75 not out). The articulate Abid Ali recalls those were the days when India was not really ready for the limited-overs brand. But, the fun of being part of that World Cup is something unforgettable, he says. Not many of the current generation may be aware that Abid Ali had a dream Test debut at Brisbane in 1967-68 series with six for 55 against Australia. So, he should know what he speaks about the World Cup and all. The Hyderabadi reveals that India did not show the team spirit desired at that level in 1975. “The team was perplexed and the concept of ODIs itself was alien to us,” he adds. One of the most infamous episodes of 1975 World Cup episode was Sunil Gavaskar’s mind-boggling 36 not out in 60 overs against England. “I still cannot believe how it happened. And I had the gumption to ask Sunny what happened – his reply was that he was not a stroke-maker. To this my reply was – don’t tell me that you got all those Test runs prior to World Cup without playing any strokes,” recalls Abid Ali. On his World Cup experience, Abid Ali says that being at Lord’s to watch West Indian captain’s blazing and match-winning century, Sir Vivian Richards amazing run-outs in the 1975 final, Kapil Dev’s incredible catch to send back Viv Richards off Madan Lal in the 1983 final were some of the great memories he would love to keep recalling even now. “What moments they were. Truly special which were equal to the grand finales,” he says. Later, SCF general secretary K. Sai Baba introduced Abid Ali to the young cricketers who were too happy to have an interaction with him.",0

The march got under way with Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy handing over the party flag to Mr. Chennithala at a public function here in the evening. Speeches of Congress leaders who addressed a large gathering of party men made it abundantly clear that all major issues prominent in the political discourse of the State would be highlighted by the march visiting all constituencies in the State. In his inaugural address, Mr. Chandy said the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had failed to deliver as it was marred by rift in the Cabinet, the leading ruling party and the ruling front. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre had sanctioned various projects and packages for the State totalling Rs.40,000 crore, he said adding the LDF government had miserably failed to implement them. The law and order situation in the State had worsened during the 32 months of the LDF rule, he said recalling the initiative of the previous United Democratic Front government to end violence in Kannur and Nadapuram. Pinarayi’s march Mr. Chandy said the march led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary Pinarayi Vijayan was leaving a trail of clashes and violence, though the march’s motto was ‘prosperous Kerala.’ He said the latest statement of CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat amounted to an admission that it had abandoned its anti-corruption plank. Lavalin issue Referring to the SNC Lavalin issue, he said the CPI(M) leadership’s reaction to the Central Bureau of Investigation’s report seeking to arraign Mr. Vijayan as one of the accused in the SNC Lavalin case was not befitting a party functioning in the democratic process. Though the CBI probe was ordered during the UDF rule, the CBI had taken over the investigation under the High Court’s instructions, he said dismissing the CPI(M) charge that the case was politically motivated. Alleging that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was involved in divisive politics, Mr. Chandy said only the Congress could ensure protection of minority communities. The Congress alone could offer a secular government, he added. In his address, Mr. Chennithala said no one could subvert the investigation in the SNC Lavalin case. He said the CPI(M) was trying to bring the BJP back to power. Mr. Karat’s announcement that his party would support any secular government formed by a non-Congress-led front amounted to abandoning the idea of a third alternative. KPCC vice-president Ramesh Chennithala presided over the function. Party leaders G. Karthikeyan, M.M. Jacob, K. Sudhakaran, P.C. Chacko, K.C. Venugopal, M.K. Raghavan, Thalekunnil Basheer, M.I.

After long hours of anxious wait for the recruitment process to continue, the students began to agitate as there was no sign of any interview. Men and women from various districts and also from Kerala and Andhra Pradesh were wooed by the advertisement of ""free admission"" to the fair in which MNCs were supposed to have participated. However, the organiser, studentsmart.in, put up six counters on the American College premises to collect a registration fee of Rs. 100 for participating in the interview.

After conducting an aptitude test for a section of aspirants, the candidates were asked to wait till 2 p.m. for the interview, which never happened. While a few representatives were in the venue, the Managing Director of the portal went missing. Enquiries by candidates with representatives about the participating companies proved futile.

It is painful for families if their young ones turn into addicts; equally challenging for doctors to treat them and a highly responsible duty for the police to nab culprits involved in illicit drug trade. The Jodhpur police have gone a step ahead, deciding to play the role of a saathi and help rehabilitate drug addicts. While playing the friendly Samaritan role, the police are working on a two-fold strategy. They have intensified crackdown on drug sellers and at the same time are facilitating a mechanism to help those who want to say ‘no’ to drugs. Western Rajasthan is known for ceremonial opium offerings but the present concern of the Jodhpur police is the increasing number of smack addicts. “Smack is a new entrant in the region but fast growing,” said Rahul Prakash, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Rural) who is the brain behind this initiative. The most alarming factor in smack addiction is that one instantly develops craving. “While it may take time for people to become addicted to liquor or opium, smack has a really quick effect,” Mr. Prakash said. It is an expensive addiction, too, which often forces youngsters to first borrow money from friends and family. When borrowing doesn’t succeed, they often end up committing thefts. “We have stepped up action against drug peddlers to break the demand and supply chain. We have seized 3.5 kg smack from January to April this year whereas last year it was just 1.5 grams in four months. We have intensified crackdown on all other drugs as well, including opium and poppy,” the senior official said. He added: “Simultaneously we have involved some social organisations to generate awareness against drug addiction and help in rehabilitation work.” The Saathi initiative aims to bring back smack addicts, mainly youths, to the mainstream of life and rehabilitate them through proper follow-up. It is basically a government initiative. “You may call it a PPT model,” Dr. Gaurav, the district programme officer at the government hospital in Jodhpur, said. The help of civil society is being taken to mobilise and create general awareness among people. Special awareness camps are being organised in schools and colleges since youth are the most vulnerable. This is part of the preventive strategy. Drug addiction is not only a menace but a social stigma also; so addicts are provided counselling to encourage them to come forward, Dr. Gaurav said. “The police are there to offer support and help as a friend, not as a guide or instructor. We want to help the youths in a friendly manner,” said Mr. Prakash. Other departments and organisations have also evinced interest, particularly the Marwar Muslim Society and Gramin Vikas Vigyan Samiti are lending active support. The de-addiction centre at the Mathura Das Mathur (MDM) government hospital, which lay almost dysfunctional for some years but now has been revved up to offer rehab facilities to affected youths. “The weakest link in any initiative is lack of follow-up,” according to Mr. Prakash; so concerned police stations have been asked to maintain Saathi registers with a database of drug addicts. When a patient is discharged from the hospital, the concerned policemen and voluntary organisations are informed so that the beat constable and social workers can make sure that the patient doesn’t fall prey to drug addiction again. The social organisations also keep in touch with the families to ensure there is no recurrence. The progress report is sent to the Superintendent of Police’s office for periodic follow-up. Of the seven drug addicts admitted at the MDM hospital, four have reportedly recovered and gone home. Special posters have also been designed to make the youths aware of the menace since 50 per cent of them admit to taking drugs following peer pressure. An awareness campaign planned for educational institutions is hoped to give further boost to the Saathi initiative.",0

Her struggle for a job despite her disability has earned her a great deal of respect from many of her friends. They also note: “Her husband did not marry her for the assistance. He takes her everywhere.” For many other visually challenged women, trusting the spouse, siblings and society is getting increasingly difficult. “I get plenty of cases of women abandoned by their husbands. Even for many families, a visually challenged girl is a liability who needs to be married off as soon as possible. There is very little focus on education,” said N.S. Venkataraman, trustee, Nandini Voice for the Deprived, at a discussion recently. The cases of men leaving their wives gain more significance in the context of the State government's scheme under which Rs.20,000 is given to the person without any disability who marries a visually challenged person. “There are many broken marriages like that, which need to be looked into,” added Mr. Venkataraman. “Instead of allowance, one of them can be given job in government according to the merit. This will ensure that such marriages remain stable,” suggested a participant. It was pouring, but that did not deter the 22 women with visual disability from far-flung areas such as Avadi, Tiruvallur and Maduravoyal from making it to the meeting, which, as one of the participants described it, was one of the few where they get to speak about their problems. Banks, said most of the women, are where they faced many problems. “Nationalised banks have very considerate rules, but they are not being implemented,” said T. Meenakshi, a school teacher. “Bank managers insist that someone accompany us all the time,” she said. Availing oneself of loans for starting entrepreneurial activity is always a Herculean task, but even procuring an ATM card is difficult. Many banks have not installed mandatory talking ATMs and so they deny us the card facility, she said. “The situation worsens when the bank managers refuse to meet us and insist that we should talk to clerical staff, who, in turn, say that they do not have the necessary authority,” she added. “We do not want sympathy. We want only understanding and a place to live with dignity,” said the women. Denial of hostel rooms has increased travel time for many of these women. This has increased the possibility of instances of molestation. “Many women face it every day, in buses, on streets, but they do not talk about it because they are never heard,” said Mr. Venkataraman. “Even the Disability Advisory Committee has only male representatives. ,” said Parameswari, a student of Ethiraj College for Women. Shortage of Braille books in schools and colleges, reluctance of the private sector to employ persons with disability and need for procedural transparency in the filling of government jobs were highlighted by these women. “The announcements in railway and bus stations are made only a few minutes before the arrival or the departure of the train or bus. A guidance counter for visually challenged persons will be of great help,” said Ms.Parameswari. “It is the general lack of respect for us in the society that concerns us the most,” said Shyamala, a student of Quaid-E-Millath Government College for Women. After the debate, as the women waded through the flooded streets of Besant Nagar, gesturing at every passing car to stop, it was the indifference of those around that stood out the most. “Very few help, especially when we need it the most,” said Ms. Shyamala.",0

Almost two years have passed since the Thekkady boat tragedy, which claimed 32 lives. Since then, the Kerala government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear life jackets. Initially, TTDC-run boat houses achieved 100 per cent compliance in ensuring tourists wear life jackets. But the numbers came down during summer season as some tourists refused to wear them since they appeared dirty, or because they knew swimming or just felt that they would not fit into their style statement. According to official sources, TTDC has placed orders for procuring 1,500 life jackets, each costing about Rs.1,100 each. It would be supplied in two phases. Udhagamandalam boat house will get a major chunk of the new purchases — 700 life jackets, followed by Yercaud (250), Pitchavaram (250), Mudaliarkuppam (200) and Muttukadu (100). Talking to The Hindu , several boat house managers said they would not allow tourists to get on the boat without life jackets . As most boat houses, barring Kodaikanal, have a single point for both entry and exit, tourists had no other choice but to obey the rules. In the recent past, tourists in row boats and pedal boats in Kodaikanal were seen without life jackets in spots where the depth was more than 60 feet. Their explanation often was either that they were averse to wearing life jackets used by others or that the protective gear was dirty. An official attached to Kodaikanal Boathouse said he was monitoring the situation closely to ensure 100 per cent compliance. Currently, they had sufficient stock including 300 new life jackets provided during July. To deal with mischief-mongers, Udhagamandalam boat house has put in place two lifesavers. Besides, the waterbody has been divided into two parts — motor boats and row/pedal boats. Lifesavers are equipped with megaphone and they constantly give instructions to tourists during the joy ride. This enabled them to achieve 100 per cent compliance, said boathouse manager C. Singaravelan. In addition to row, motor and pedal boats, Mudaliarkuppam and Muttukadu boat houses have water scooters and the compliance level is cent per cent.",0

Following her suicide, perhaps haunted by existential angst that many creative minds are prone to, the life of Rajalekshmi has become the topic of numerous articles, stories and sometimes even mournful lyrics. There is even this curious argument that her suicide catapulted Rajalekshmi into fame, subtly implying that her stories do not really merit the critical acclaim they presently enjoy. Rajalekshmi was born on June 2, 1930 in Amayankod tharavadu at Cherpulassery in Palakkad, as the youngest daughter of Marath Achutha Menon and Kutty Malu Amma. A post-graduate in Physics from Banaras Hindu University, she served as lecturer in N.S.S Colleges at Perunthanni, Pandalam and Ottappalam. In 1956, she made a spectacular entry into the Malayalam literary field with the publication of a short story, ‘Makal’ (‘Daughter’). Her next remarkable achievement was the novel Oru Vazhiyum Kure Nizhalukalum (‘ One Pathway, Many Shadows’) serialised in a Malayalam weekly in 1958 and later published as a book that fetched her the Kerala Sahithya Akademi award for the year 1960. In the same year the same magazine started serialising her novel Ucha Veyilum Ilam Nilavum (Scorching Sun, Soothing Moonlight) but after six issues Rajalekshmi decided to stop publishing the novel on account of some threats that disturbed her to a great extent. She is said to have made her first attempt at committing suicide around this time. She wrote her last novel titled Njaan Enna Bhaavam (Egomania) in 1964. While this work was being serialised, Rajalekshmi took her life on January 18, 1965. A close reading of the works of Rajalekshmi would bring home the fact that almost all her writings were inward looking in two senses: one, her writings are more or less concerned with the woman’s struggle within the domestic space, as daughters, mothers or wives; two, most of her protagonists happen to be women who tend to be obsessed with a sense of disquiet and anxiety. For instance in ‘The Apology’, Rema’s distress on hearing the answer of one of the students, Paul Verghese, that the most disgusting pronoun is ‘She!’ happens to be the crux of the story. Again, the core theme of ‘The Defeated One’ is the heroine Nirmala’s disillusionment with the choice that she had made in her marital life and the struggle she has to undergo owing to the emotional attraction she feels towards her superior officer. The story ends with Nirmala’s decision to abide by the social norms a married woman is expected to follow. A decision difficult to make, and the sub-text of the narrative makes it amply clear where the sympathies of the author lie. Rajalekshmi continues to remain a shadowy and mysterious figure to all those who happen to come across her works. Since the protagonists of most of her stories and novels are women, they might be voicing the mental agony and distress which the author herself had experienced during the course of her life or which she might have seen in the lives of those who were close to her as in the story ‘Suicide’, which narrates the tragic end of Neeraja Chakravarti. Having left this world with no memoirs or journals or letters or any other memorabilia which could have helped us gain a closer look at her life, the real cause of Rajalekshmi’s suicide still eludes us, though there is no reason why as readers we should probe into the private self of a writer to understand the writing better. Probably Rajalekshmi had intended her writings to play the role of memoirs or life-texts. Rajalekshmi was generally known to be a recluse. Acquaintances say that she was an introvert by nature and had few close friends. What grants a distinct quality to the writings of Rajalekshmi is the remarkable resilience her heroines display in spite of their domestic and marital struggles and the compromises they had to strike. They have the ability to see through the hypocrisy of those around them and smile ironically at their own misfortunes. However, the supreme irony is that the creator of these women characters chose to embrace death, meeting death with the warmth with which one would greet a lover. The experience of love as she imagined it is so powerful and self consuming that it can find its consummation only in death. In the poem ‘I Love You’, she says, “You are /As desirable as life / As fascinating as death”. Indeed, love and death are enmeshed in Rajalekshmi’s works and because she could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for her. (A fortnightly column on the many avatars of women in Malayalam literature. G. S. Jayasree is head of the Institute of English, and editor of Samyukta) Since the protagonists of most of her stories and novels are women, they might be voicing the mental agony and distress which the author herself had experienced during the course of her life or which she might have seen in the lives of those who were close to her",0

In the instant case also, the contract was awarded after due diligence after the bid was found technically responsive,” Mr.Gadkari said. On Monday, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh alleged that Mr.Gadkari had indulged in “crony capitalism” to hand over a contract of constructing the Zojila Pass Tunnel worth Rs.1,050 crore and further alleged that Mr.Gadkari’s son, Nikhil Gadkari, had been a shareholder of Ideal Energy, a subsidiary of IRB Infrastructure Developers. He further alleged companies that had initially shown interest to build the tunnel ended up withdrawing their tenders as they were “given specific signals to withdraw or face consequences in other projects.” In a detailed explanation, Mr.Gadkari described the bidding history of the project starting from the time the technical bid was first opened in 2013. He said only one developer had bid for the project on two occasions earlier, leading to the cancellation of the bidding process. Based on these experiences, the government had to subsequently change the bidding process. From a two-stage procedure, wherein both request for quotation , or technical bid, and request for proposal , or financial bid were invited, a single stage process of inviting the RFP was followed.",0

He was part of a team of students of the Institute of Archaeology of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, on a study tour. Later in the day, vans transporting the students to the Tiruchi airport from Thanjavur were pelted with stones resulting in damage to windshields. However, the students escaped unhurt. In Thanjavur, the students and staff, 19 in total, were going around the Sri Brahadeeswara Temple when a group owing allegiance to the Naam Tamizhar Katchi and Thamizh Desiya Podhuvudamai Katchi attacked Ven. Gnanaloka Thero, who stood out in the group in his saffron robe. The students were taken to the ASI office near the temple, but the assailants surrounded the office and demanded that the monk be sent out. The incident sent shock waves among devotees and archakas who were witness to the attack. Gnanaloka Thero was asked to change his clothes and sent to Tiruchi along with other students with police escort in vans. As the vehicles entered Tiruchi, two cabs transporting the students were targeted near Ariyamangalam and G Corner, where members of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Naam Tamizhar Katchi attacked the vehicles with sticks and stones, police said. The front windshield of one of the vans and the rear one in the other were damaged. However, the students were escorted safely to the airport. City Commissioner of Police Shailesh Kumar Yadav met the students upon their arrival at the airport. The monk was put on a Chennai-bound flight later in the evening, while the others were accommodated at the airport temporarily. The students hailed from different countries, including Sri Lanka, China and Thailand and from the Northern states in India. All of them are studying Postgraduate Diploma in Archaeology (PGDA) in New Delhi. Their proposed visit to Darasuram and Gangaikondacholapuram were cancelled following the incident Gnanaloka Thero has been staying in New Delhi for the last one-and-half years pursuing the diploma course.

He was working with the Archaeological Department in Sri Lanka before coming to India to pursue the course. “We arrived in Thanjavur by train on Saturday morning and were taken on a field visit to Big Temple when the assault took place at around 9.30 a.m. Soon after, we were all put in two vehicles immediately and sent to Tiruchi,” he said. Eleven persons, including A.Nalladurai, State coordinator of Naam Thamizhar Katchi and Pazha.Rajendran of the Thamizh Desiya Podhuvudamai Katchi, were arrested in Thanjavur, while 10 persons, including MDMK rural district secretary, Tiruchi, were held in Tiruchi in connection with the stone-throwing incident.",1

Former Energy Secretary to the Union Government E.A.S. Sarma said the deal would in no way benefit the Indian energy and technological sectors but would have a lot of impact on country’s foreign policy, as it would surrender to the US. India can do without the deal as it has already amassed a lot of nuclear technology and know-how he felt and also pointed out that Indian scientists are consulted as the country has a very good record of safety standards. Dr. Sarma said the nuke deal would only help India to raise its nuclear power production by four percent, up to seven per cent of total power production and India had to compromise a lot. In the near future land, minerals, water and forests would become big issues and the politicians and parties would have no place if they did not fight for the people on theses issues, he said. CPI (M) leader and Deputy Leader of PDF in Legislative Council M.V.S. Sarma wanted the fact that the nuclear deal would further push India into US hegemony and would not derive any benefit should be made known to the people. The US was firing at the China from the shoulders of India as our neighbour was its biggest threat in future. But the Indian Government did not understand this fact and on the other hand was happy that the US was showing interest in India. “It is the right time and high time to provide all information (about the deal) to the people,” he said. The speakers regretted that India, at the behest of the US, voted in favour of sanctions against Iran forgetting the fact that both countries enjoyed thousands of years of old relationship.",0

He said Mr. Mukherjee himself had sought support from all political parties for his candidature and had recently referred to Ms. Banerjee as his sister. Seeking the support of all legislators from West Bengal, Mr Ahmed said the entire State was feeling “elated” after the announcement of the candidature of Mr. Mukherjee. “We appeal to all like-minded MLAs to support him,” he said. Mr. Mukherjee is expected to come to the State on July 8.

Today’s headlines. Theatre director, Joanna Nawang was executed in front of a firing squad at dawn.” Akash Mohimen’s Under the Chestnut Tree is not about gentle beginnings. Drama is evoked right away, the reader robbed of warm-up time and all along fed those little dramatic doses. What began as an idea for a short film for this “prematurely balding and seemingly malnourished writer” who works as a film editor to pay his bills, finally found its full voice in the format of a play. Under the Chestnut Tree travels through art censorship, artistic rivalry and notions of morality, but does so with a touch of wit. Here colours are rebellion, so each artist’s canvas is a play in black and white. And each in his/her own way works around this censorship on creativity. The subject is vastly different from what Akash has done earlier. The 28-year-old from Jamshedpur studied Political Science in Mumbai before settling for creative writing. The playwright has done children’s plays before taking a different step with Mahua — a love story that opened the Writer’s Bloc 3 Festival last year. Under the Chestnut Tree , a satire that teases the idea of a physical context or a time frame, is a new attempt from Akash. “I was just creating a world taking inspiration from actual and historical events and seeing how people behave in a totalitarian State.

They may be a distortion of reality, but let us be charitable. By attributing these qualities to these insentient elements, these Nature lovers are only trying to integrate them into their world. I have often caught myself engaging in this exercise.

So, I am not surprised when the word 'majestic' rolls off my tongue involuntarily as I come upon the Keerapakkam hills.

Keerapakkam derives its charm almost entirely from these hills. This village panchayat, located off the Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road and accessed via a road branching off this state highway at Mellakotaiyur, is sufficiently inhabited for the Metropolitan Transport Corporation to operate bus services to it with reasonable frequency. While heading towards these hills, I notice two buses swish past me, in the opposite direction. One is them is from Tambaram to Keerapakkam. And the other, if my eyesight has not failed me, is from Guduvanchery to Keerapakkam Koot Road. Later, with some research, I discover that the service from Tambaram is operated with a 50-minute frequency. Though Keerapakkam is well-populated, the human element is put in the shade by those 'majestic' hills. One of these hills is accustomed to the tread of tyres and feet from other parts of the city. It has a Baba temple. A concrete road takes visitors up to a point. From there, they have to climb to the summit. From the other side of the hill, there is a route for people to reach this same point, either walking or riding a motorcycle. This stretch makes for an energising walk. A view of this hill with the Keerapakkam lake in the foreground is arresting. Heading out from this hill, one can reach a few other hills, taking a matrix of roads, most of them well-laid. The other hills in and around Keerapakkam don't betray much of human movement and climbing them early in the morning can be an enchanting experience. Besides climbing these hills, just treading down these quiet roads in this sound-proofed region gives you a sense of disdainfully throwing the problems of existence over your shoulder and walking away from them.

A spokesman of the Saudi Arabian Interior Ministry, Mansour Al-Turki, said that in the light of the assassination of one of its diplomats, Hassan Misfer Al-Qahtani, Riyadh would review the “security of Saudi diplomatic missions in Pakistan with a view to ensuring adequate protection to diplomats, staff and their dependents”. In Islamabad, Interior Minister Rehman Malik held al-Qaeda responsible for the diplomat's slaying. “Undoubtedly al-Qaeda has had a role in the assassination of the Saudi diplomat,” Iran's Fars News Agency quoted Mr. Malik as saying. Revenge killing Analysts point out that the assassination of the diplomat could be seen as an act of assertion by al-Qaeda following the killing in Pakistan of Osama bin Laden, the head of the organisation. Al-Qaeda has since the erstwhile Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan targeted the House of Saud because of its close military ties with the Americans. On Wednesday, circles close to al-Qaeda announced the name of Saif el-Adal as the group's new head. Observers say Mohammad Ilyas Kashmiri and Adnan G.

Addressing a massive gathering of party workers and sympathisers from in and around the city at the ‘maha dharna' organised in the vicinity of the Collector's office here on Monday, Mr. Naidu said the Rosaiah Government has failed on all fronts and neglected agriculture as reflected in the acute shortage of fertilizer faced by the farmers. Taking a dig at Chief Minister K. Rosaiah, he wondered how he gave appointment to Kadapa Mayor P. Ravindranath Reddy, who is facing charges under Section 420 of IPC in diversion of fertilizer case. He did not spare Agriculture Minister N.Raghuveera Reddy and challenged his claims that the farmers under Congress rule are prosperous and are able to afford corporate hospital treatment to their family members in case of serious ailments. If the farmers benefitted a lot, why did 7000 farmers commit suicide during the last six years, he asked. ‘Pavala Vaddi' scheme has become a farce he said and asked the farmers if any of them got it. They instantly responded by shouting a firm “no”. The TDP president lambasted the government for doing injustice to the farmers of 111 special economic zones in the State. Lands of farmers are purchased at throw away prices, while private parties are allowed to earn huge profits, he said. Referring to the Knowledge City proposal in Chilamattur mandal in the district, he said land was bought at Rs.50,000 per acre while middlemen benefitted immensely from the subsequent deals.

Most commercially available napkins use cellulose fibre to increase their absorption capacity. But the lower surface area of the fibre limits the absorption capacity. In order to enhance the absorption capacity, some brands use superabsorbent polymers (cross-linked sodium polyacrylate gels). When polymerised acrylate is added to cellulose, the resulting product has enormous ability to absorb water, which has caused an increased use of this substance in the production of hygiene products such as sanitary napkins. Chandra Shekhar Sharma from the Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Hyderabad and his team turned to nanotechnology to produce cellulose-based nanofibre for use as an absorbent core in sanitary napkins. They chose cellulose acetate biopolymer and subjected it to electrospinning to synthesise fibre of nanoscale size. Compared with micron-sized fibre used in commercially available products, the absorption capacity of napkins with nanofibre was higher due to greater surface area and higher porosity. “The more the surface area of the fibres the more will be the absorption capacity,” Prof. Sharma says. “The nanofibre has 4-8 times the surface area of microfibre.” The results were published in the journal Applied Materials Today. They tested commercially available napkins and the nanofibre samples in the lab using distilled water, saline solution and synthetic urine. In the case of distilled water, at the end of 180 seconds, napkins with a superabsorbent layer had a higher absorption capacity compared with nanofibre samples. However, nanofibre samples had 50 per cent more absorbance than those that either had little or very less superabsorbent polymers. In the case of saline solution, the nanofibre samples had 53-63 per cent greater absorption capacity compared with the rest of the commercially available samples, including those which had superabsorbent polymers. “The basic driving force for absorbency is the difference in osmotic pressure inside and outside the fabric,” Prof. Sharma says. “The superabsorbent polymers have sodium ions. So the osmotic pressure is less as there is sodium inside and outside the polymers. The more the osmotic pressure the more the absorption.” Similar results were seen when synthetic urine was tested. The nanofibre samples had 28-66 per cent better performance than all the commercially available samples. “Like the sodium solution, synthetic urine, too, contains sodium. So the osmotic pressure is less, and there is less absorption of water,” says Shital Yadav from IIT Hyderabad, the first author of the paper. The electrospun nanofibre samples performed better even when they were subjected to mechanical compression. In the case of commercially available napkins, compression decreased the surface area and porosity and restricted the absorption capacity of even the samples with superabsorbent polymers. Also, compared with commercially available napkins, the mechanical strength and comfort were better in the case of electrospun nanofibre samples. “Unlike commercially available napkins that use microfibre, nanofibre is smooth and has uniform roughness. These make the nanofibre samples more comfortable,” says Mani Pujitha Illa, one of the authors of the paper, from IIT Hyderabad. The team is carrying out studies to test the performance of electrospun nanofibre to absorb body discharge fluids. “The pH and ionic concentration determine the absorption capacity of superabsorbent polymers. Body discharge fluids have a pH and ionic concentration comparable to sodium solution,” Prof. Sharma says. So he is optimistic that electrospun nanofibre would be able to better-absorb body discharge fluids than superabsorbent polymers. The absorption capacity of napkins with nanofibre was higher due to greater surface area",0

Traders pulled down their shutters to join the statewide agitation to oppose the State Government's move to amend the APMC Act on Friday. Several traders under the banner of Belgaum Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI) staged a demonstration in front of the Deputy Commissioner's office. BCCI president Vikas R. Kalghatagi led the protest. MOU signed According to BCCI, the anxiety of the farming community and foodgrain traders had come true when a Memorandum of Understanding between Bharathi Enterprises of India and Wal-Mart of the USA was signed. The MoU opened entry of Foreign Direct Investment in the retail trade. Unfortunately, the MoU was signed ignoring the fact that entry of Wal-Mart in retail trade in other countries had ruined native traders and the farming community owing to monopolisation of trading activities in the foodgrain sector. Ironically, growing levels of poverty among farmers was one of its contributions. The BCCI said the Government of India had advised the state governments to amend the Act only to suit the requirements of Wal-Mart. The Karnataka Government had already directed officials to issue an ordinance amending the Act soon. Mr. Kalghatagi alleged that the State Government had taken steps to amend the Act without consulting the farming community or the traders' organisations, which would be directly affected by the amendment. He submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister, Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Food & Civil Supplies. While strongly opposing the proposed amendment, he said the BCCI had urged the Government to review its decision to transfer the national market to foreign companies in view of the latter making quick inroads into domestic retail markets.

Even out of this small amount, the company could not realise Rs 95.5 lakh from Local Cable Operators till November 2010,” the report said. The report further added: To earn this revenue, the company incurred Rs 10.59 crore ( being the payments made to pay channels Rs 2.71 crore, lease charges for fibre cables Rs 2.16 crore and establishment, rent and other incidentals Rs 5.72 crore. Thus the overall operations of the company resulted in a cash loss of Rs 8.11 crore”. The CAG said that the project proposals approved (July 2008) by the Government indicated that the company's estimated project cost of Rs 91.59 crore would be paid back in four years and three months, subject to achievement of anticipated connections—15.20 lakh connections in the first year of operation with five per cent cumulative annual growth. But the patronage proved a damp squib. The report is quite damning in this regard. It pointed out that after installation of the digital heads, “the company started with a baby step and procured a consumer base of only 34,350 in August 2008 which expanded to 55,705 in October 2010. But it could not expand further due to non-availability of popular channels”. The report observed that the company ventured into a highly competitive business and commenced its commercial operations immediately after the clearance of the proposal by the project investment committee in the same month. However, “in the absence of proper strategy to procure telecasting rights of popular channels and increase the consumer base and firm agreements with local cable operators for assured patronage resulted in a cash loss of Rs 8.11 crore, besides unfruitful creation of infrastructure worth Rs 28.28 crore.” It also said that the Government stated (August 2010) that its aim of formation of this company was not to augment the revenue but to provide high quality television signals at a reasonable cost to public. The fact, however, remained that even this objective was not achieved as the company did not make headway in enlarging the customer base as envisaged till November 2010 resulting in “continued poor performance”.",0

India humbled the hosts by 133 runs via Duckworth/Lewis method after the visitors posted 304 for six while batting first. Dhoni said that Raina’s knock made the difference. “By the end of the 30th over, we had not scored too many runs. It was important that he stayed at the crease because he was a set batsman. And we have realised that if we can get a partnership going and have wickets in hand, we can score a lot of runs in the last 10-12 overs. So his innings was very crucial in that respect,” he added. Raina and Dhoni put up 144 runs for the fifth wicket, batting together for 16.5 overs and scoring at 8.55 runs per over, as India plundered 147 runs in the last 15 overs. The Indian skipper himself scored 52 runs, but the star of the day was surely Raina, who hit 12 fours and 3 sixes during his stay at the crease. Ravindra Jadeja also stood up with his 4-28 in seven overs as England collapsed to 161 all out in 38.1 overs. It further improved Jadeja’s ODI record against England, especially in the limited-overs format. That left Alastair Cook frustrated and the England skipper said his teammates will have to improve their game immensely to bounce back in the five-match series. “If we play like that we’re not going to win many games of cricket,” said Cook. “But the talent in the changing room is there and we’ve got a lot of improvement to do. We didn’t play very well, and we’ve paid for that today,” he said.PTI",0

While the leaders of the major political parties are busy participating in public meetings and road shows, functionaries are engaged in door-to-door canvassing never mind the the scorching sun. That the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) are taking the elections seriously is evident in the fact that stalwarts of these parties are campaigning in earnest for their respective candidates. With only a couple of days left for the curtains to fall on public campaigning, voters still await star campaigners, including ‘Dream girl' Hema Malini. While the Opposition parties targeted the BJP for alleged scams and misadministration, the BJP banked on the development mantra and spoke about the corrupt practices and failures of the rival parties. Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramiah, KPCC president G. Parameshwara and Minister of State for Railways K.H. Muniyappa led the Congress campaign trail in the constituency. The party organised a number of conventions which were addressed by Union Labour Minister M. Mallikarjun Kharge, the former Chief Minister, Dharam Singh, senior leaders D.K. Shivkumar, V.S.

Narayanaswamy, Bandeppa Kashempur, MLA G.K. Venkatashiva Reddy are among others who joined the JD(S) campaigning. As for the BJP, Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa has been leading from the front. He took up two whirlwind tours in the constituency. Home and Transport Minister R. Ashok and Minister for Power Shobha Karandlaje are the other two other prominent BJP leaders camping in the area to garner support for the voters.

It has organised a political convention to mobilise support to secular forces. CPI (M) State secretariat members G.C. Bayya Reddy and G.N. Nagaraj, State committee member Gandhinagar Narayanaswamy, district secretary G. Arjunan are the prominent leaders involved in the campaigning.

The money would be given to those recommended by the commission of inquiry that had already been set up, she told journalists at the State Secretariat here. “The relief fund will help the most ordinary and small investors who have lost everything. This cannot be done arbitrarily. We shall act according to the recommendations of the commission,” she said. Ms. Banerjee said the police had started seizing the property and assets of the Saradha Group, and they would be auctioned off to repay the investors. The fund would be in addition to the sum to be raised from the auction. “Suicide is not an alternative,” she said, assuring the people that her government would do all it could. Days after the group of chit fund companies shut down its operations, at least two persons have killed themselves, while others have attempted suicide. Ms. Banerjee announced an additional 10 per cent tax on tobacco and tobacco products to raise money for the fund. “We may raise about Rs. 150 crore from this additional tax…We shall have to see where we arrange the rest from.” To justify her decision, she pointed out that some States imposed up to 50 per cent tax on tobacco and tobacco products, but West Bengal levied 25 per cent. As the names of Trinamool Congress leaders have figured in the scam, Ms. Banerjee warned the Opposition against “heating up the political atmosphere” over an issue that concerned the people. “They are targeting one journalist and bad-mouthing him… If I wanted, I could reveal the names of several journalists who are involved,” she said, referring to Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha member Kunal Ghosh, who was the Media CEO of the Saradha Group and who has been implicated in the fraud.",0

Replacement of existing equipment in telephone exchanges with Internet Protocol (IP)-based NGN switches is proposed to be carried out in a phased manner in BSNL’s Chennai Telephones and Tamil Nadu circles. In essence, the migration to IP-driven packet-based switches and servers under the IP Multimedia Subsystems Management 2000 series will set the stage for Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) that is touted as the next level in telecom evolution. The FMC breaks down the distinctions between fixed and mobile networks and provides customers seamless inter-operability of wired and wireless voice and broadband services at home, office or while on the move. Implemented as part of a nationwide upgrade of core communication architecture in BSNL, it is expected that the migration would be completed in the next three to four years. The NGN architecture is being supplied by Chinese vendor Huawei. Currently, most BSNL telephones exchanges are powered by switches from OCB (Alcatel), AXE (Ericsson), EWSD (Siemens) and 5ESS (Lucent AT&T). In Chennai Telephones, a two-phase plan has been worked out to upgrade 48 telephone exchanges to NGN levels. The roll out of NGN architecture of switches and servers networking close to a million landlines in the Chennai Telephones network will take at least three years, the official said. The upgrade Upgrading of telephone exchanges to NGN is also under way in the Tamil Nadu circle which recently placed an order for gear worth Rs. 11 crore.

Her mother is Poonam Kanwar, to whom a baby boy was given on March 25 but was replaced by the girl child, with the hospital authorities pleading a mistake. Though Poonam and her husband Chain Singh refused to accept their explanation, the woman volunteered to suckle the girl child and now she turns to be her biological mother. The DNA test result, expedited by the laboratory in Delhi after the intervention of court and authorities, confirmed what the hospital found earlier after matching the blood group of the parents. Chain Singh, who initially refused to own the girl child after the hospital authorities took away the baby boy, was present in the court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Jodhpur when the envelope containing the DNA test result was opened on Thursday afternoon. After the findings became known, Singh immediately agreed to accept the girl child. The controversy over the parentage of the girl child, which nobody seemed keen on taking, and the boy arose when the hospital staff, apparently by mistake, swapped the two children born the same night — March 25. The boy was first given to Poonam, but two hours later she was told that hers was a girl child and the boy belonged to Reshma Devi and Sagar Ram of Wayatu in Barmer district. Immediately, there was ruckus outside the hospital as Chain Singh and his family members from Siwana, also in Barmer district, protested that he was being deprived of the male child. While the boy remained with Reshma, the girl child, kept in the hospital nursery, was deprived of mother's milk in the first few days. Later Poonam volunteered to suckle the child — while not accepting it as her own — but the hospital authorities did not allow her. The child was later breastfed by her on court intervention. All's well that ends well. Now, the girl child is accepted by her parents. However, Chain Singh has filed a petition in the Metropolitan Court asking for damages to the tune of Rs.10 lakh from the hospital authorities — for the distress and inconvenience the episode caused him because of their “negligence” in handling the newborn.

I am lying face down, staring into a bowl of water with a hibiscus in it. If I lift my head, before me is the deep blue sea, and hovering over me is a masseuse working magic on my muscles. Like I said, it is a good life. I am at Club Med's Cherating Beach Eco Resort, in Kuantan, Pahang, on the east coast of Malaysia, unwinding in a tropical paradise. I am smugly thinking of all the conversations I will have back home, peppered with comments such as, “The sailing was good in the South China Sea”, or, “While I was in the Jacuzzi….”, or, “oh, the Mojitos were divine!” Yeah, you get the idea. My room faces the sea. It is beautifully appointed, elegant, understated and comfortable. Gloriously-creaky verandas skirt the rooms. The local and traditional architecture is at its most charming, and is mentioned in the Guinness World Records as the longest unbroken wooden house in the world. It is built on stilts as most homes on the Malaysian coast are, in order to remain safe from flood waters and wild life. If I have a mind to, I could spend all day, just sitting there and staring into the South China Sea. But, that would be criminal as the glorious outdoors beckon. There is plenty to do and lot of space to do it in. It is an 80-hectare property with four km of coastline all its own. The birds give a rousing cheer as I emerge from my room and walk towards the reception. I pause respectfully as a giant monitor lizard ambles by. This happens often at Cherating. It is obvious why Club Med prides itself on being a worldwide leader in up-scale, personalised holidays. Everything you could possibly want is right there — from a gym for the city slicks who are happy only if they sweat it out on machines to the great outdoors for those who want to do yoga on the beach. A walk in the tropical forest, rock climbing, bungee jumping, archery, tennis, football, squash, golf…take your pick, or do them all. Then, cool off either in the ocean, or the pool just a holler away from the round-the-clock bar. The food is great and ample. Long counters groan under its weight. There is world cuisine up for grabs with the best of Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Italian, Mexican and Malayan fare. Slice yourself some French cheese, pare an exotic fruit, and agonise over the dessert menu. After their initial shock when you decline the caviar and the pate de foie gras, the chefs rally around and rustle up a formidable vegetarian meal. They are solicitous and anxious that you don't feel left out as others feast on the wealth of meat, fish and poultry. You can do splendidly with luscious fruit, incredible salads, yoghurt, freshly-baked bread, and so on. Family destination Mumtaz Moin, Head, Club Med Services India, points out why Cherating Beach resort is a complete family holiday destination. The facilities for children will earn you their eternal gratitude. There are play stations, musical instruments, Internet, a movie hall and enough place to have their own parties, or just hang out, undisturbed by the adults. For the younger kids, there are trained people who read to them, take them out on excursions, supervise their meals and even take care of their nap time. This gives you the freedom to do your own thing and stop feeling guilty. Rustling palms, rippling waves, chirping birds apart, there is nothing to come between you and total relaxation at Club Med Cherating. Of course, all rooms are WiFi-enabled. So, go ahead and keep in touch with the outside world. As for me, I tuck a fragrant gardenia firmly behind my ear, and walk into the sunset.

The striking students said they were being overworked and made to do all kinds of routine work that was not part of their duties. They demanded that they be relieved from administering injections and IV fluids and writing indents for medicines. The students also complained that they were asked to transport blood samples and blood bags, a job that should be done by paramedical staff. They also wanted a shift system instead of being made to work 36 hours non-stop. As the protest gathered momentum, health secretary J.

The Chromebook has taken it to the extreme: it’s a laptop that is little more than a browser window. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. Based on Google’s Chrome internet browser it offers everything the average user might need. It’s all online But it’s all online, meaning the minute a Chromebook is disconnected from the internet, it essentially stops working. Everything from web browsing to word processing to videos and games on the Chromebook runs on apps. It’s not even immediately obvious one is working online. “The programmes and the data aren’t stored on the computer, but in the internet,” explains ans Stahl, dean of the computer science department at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences. There are some special offline apps so users can check email and work on documents when disconnected, provided they were downloaded before the connection was cut. That means relying a lot on hotspots when moving around. Some Chromebooks can make their own mobile connections, but that’s far from standard. Using a Chromebook also means becoming dependent upon Google. Additionally, all work done on a Chromebook will eventually end up on a Google server. Advantages Of course, there are advantages to always being online. If a computer crashes or is lost, the data remains accessible somewhere in the net. And, since everything is in the cloud, it’s easy to save work on one computer and resume it on another machine. Nor do Chrome OS and its apps require a lot of heavy duty hardware. It can get by with a smaller flash drive, as opposed to the larger drives required on some laptops. However, Chromebooks have yet to really take off . The problem is that they don’t really appeal to people on the go. And companies, most of which rely upon Windows, are unlikely to make the switch.DPA",0

It dramatically delineated episodes like love affair between Vasistha and the Harijan girl Arundhati (daughter of Matanga who belonged to a community which lived by making leather and leathern articles), its culmination in a happy wedlock, separation as Vasistha incredibly gets indignant and drifted under the influence of his old friend Praacheena, inequitably an adamant votary of casteism and fallacious untouchability, Arundhati remaining unperturbed and intensely meditating on Lord Siva, Vasistha realising his folly and getting reunited with Arundhati and finally Siva granting them Darshan and blessing them to get adored ideally as an exemplary couple for ever. All actors, especially B. Vijayasai as Vasistha, A. Sitamahalakshmi as Arundhati, S. Mamatha as her sister Sandhya, P. Pratap as Sivoham, P. Ramana Murty as Praacheena, V. Jayaraj as Kulagiri, K.

More often than not, we start with one topic, click on a few links and within no time are reading about something else. Qwikipedia is a game that tries to quench this curiosity in us. The objective is to get to a particular wiki page, starting from a specific article, using minimal clicks. There is no single correct answer, so we might surprise ourselves by finding new routes each time! Monday’s Marauder Ronaldinho —> Harvard Medical School Ronaldinho I was in class 10 back then. Brazil were playing England in the quarterfinal and the score was 1-1 when Brazil were awarded a free kick. While the rest of the players milled around the penalty area, Ronaldinho, taking the free kick from 35 metres out, spotted that England’s goalkeeper David Seaman was off his line. He curled in an outrageous free kick, scoring what eventually became the winner in that game. Brazil went on to win the World Cup that year (2002) but this goal remains my stand out memory from that edition. Ronaldinho, with his blind passes, overhead kicks, tricks and free kicks, has produced many such memories. He did produce one such equaliser for Atletico Mineiro against Raja Casablanca in the semi-final of the recently concluded Club World Cup, but it wasn’t enough as Raja went on to win 3-1. Brazil Are you aware that Brazil is not only playing host to the FIFA World Cup in 2014, but is also the chosen venue for the Olympic Games in 2016 (Rio de Janeiro)? As a result, a lot of money is being pumped into the economy, so that they can make the most of these events. Some, however, fear that all this could hit the country’s growth as well. Brazil, with its capital at Brasilia, comes in as the fifth largest country in the world at the moment - irrespective of whether you are listing countries by geographical area or in terms of population. Miscegenation Ever since the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, miscegenation between various groups of people in Brazil began. Miscegenation is derived from Latin words miscere for “to mix” and genus for “kind”. So when people of different racial groups get mixed through marriage, sexual relations and procreation, it is known as miscegenation. Historically, this term has been used in the context of the judiciary. Anti-miscegenation laws used to ban interracial marriage and sex. Harvard Medical School Studies on miscegenation are quite common. In terms of the Indian subcontinent, a study in 2009 by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in collaboration with Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard School of Public Health and Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT stated that castes in South Asia were not a product of Aryan invasion on the basis of analysing genetic markers. A graduate medical school of Harvard University, HMS was recently fined by the Federal regulators for animal welfare violations – care of monkeys used in their research in particular. So the path that we have traversed today is: Ronaldinho —> Brazil —> Miscegenation —> Harvard Medical School Three clicks! Hop over.

As the third edition of NDTV's Greenathon comes to a close we catch up with the brand ambassador on an issue which is fast becoming a centre of attraction for stars and celebrities. She discreetly avoids discussion on 7 Khoon Maaf, which failed to make a killing at the box office and maintains silence on Barfee, her next stop at meaningful entertainment with director Anurag Basu. Here goes our PC, all charged yet formatted! As you seem serious about it, what kind of homework did you do before taking up this challenge? I guess a lot of things associated with environment protection are about applying common sense but did you go into details like how CFCs contribute towards depleting the ozone layer? It's important to know what you are talking about and what you are asking people to do and so yes, I do a fair amount of homework before I associate with anything. With regards to the environment, I believe that even in today's world where information is so freely available, there is still such a lack of understanding on the issues that plague us and what we can do as individuals to help. From my point of view, it is important to create awareness about the little things we can do, applying common sense as you put it, to help stem the abuse we are inflicting on the environment. Simple things like switching off lights and fans when not in use, car-pooling, saving paper, recycling of all the materials we use, etc. are things that if every one of us implements, it has the power to make such a difference. We have to start there first...make a conscious effort in our everyday lives. In the same vein, it also has to be tackled on a larger level from a governmental and even big business point of view. The other aspects are also extremely important as well, but the idea is to first start with areas where the layman understands and is able to contribute and then move into the other, larger concerns of the environment. I am told you have visited villages with the NDTV team. How was the experience? Yes I did, and this was a huge learning experience. We seem to be so comfortable in our own everyday lives that we forget what hardships such a large part of our country faces.... No light, no electricity, water shortages, etc. One of the most telling memories for me was standing in Manawas village (in Rajasthan) in pitch darkness. This was their everyday life and if it weren't for the solar lanterns that they received thanks to the efforts of the NDTV Greenathon, they would have no light at all. I saw firsthand how a lantern had improved their lives in so many ways. From studying to delivering a baby, they could now do these with more ease and not have to deal with the fumes and heat generated by the kerosene lamps that they used before. In some ways, is the so called hinterland more aware about the environment without making news? I really don't think that any awareness in these villages about the environment issues exists. In the rural areas, I think today awareness is being created for more basic issues like the need for education, basic hygiene, etc. and environmental issues are not a priority. One of the most distressing sights for me was the sight of plastic and other garbage strewn around the village. It's a sign of where things are headed and therefore something that we have to bring awareness to immediately within the local communities before it spirals out of control. Where do you stand in the environment vs. development debate? Does our contribution end with switching off the lights because a star is pleading? Anything you do, however small, is a start, even it means that you are just switching off lights when it's not in use. My aim is not only to bring awareness but also to highlight the various workable solutions that exist. Development is critical but not at the cost of the environment. I think there are efforts being made to ensure that the two work hand in hand but we have to be cautious that everything is not placed under the garb of ‘development' and thereby sidelining the effects on the environment. Do you think a Priyanka Chopra can contribute more to environment awareness than somebody like Rajendra Pachauri? Can stars do something more concrete like adopting a village? Vivek has done it... Yes I feel privileged that I have an audience that will give me a patient ear for what I have to say and I am happy to use that privilege for a good cause. Why can't individuals from different walks of life who have different audiences connect and work collectively for the same cause? It's what we're doing with the NDTV Greenathon, working together to spread the message to as many people as possible. With regards to doing something more concrete, there are many of my friends from the industry who not only came on board last year to help raise awareness but also adopted multiple villages each in support of the cause. I adopted five villages as well. We seem to be so comfortable in our own everyday lives that we forget what hardships such a large part of our country faces.... No light, no electricity, water shortages, etc. One of the most telling memories for me was standing in Manawas village (in Rajasthan) in pitch darkness…",0

There was a time when she used to get irritated at the mere mention of “Julie” and what followed. Films like “Sheesha” and “Kya Kool Hain Hum” slotted her as the bombshell for the lowest common denominator. Today, she wilfully discloses that it was she who suggested director Anees Bazmee to name her character Julie. “It is a funny character who lives in delusions. Anees wanted to name it Rosy. I suggested why not Julie. Life has come a full circle for me. Today I can laugh at myself.” The new found confidence has come from films like “Ek Chalis Ki Last Local”, “Mithya” and some “intelligent films” that are in her kitty. “There was a time when I used to fume at critics for being too critical of films like ‘Julie’ and ‘Kya Kool’..., as they were commercially successful. I have realised when they praise ‘Taare Zameen Par’, they have the right to give the devil its due.” The twist Neha’s career graph changed the day she found Rajat Kapoor working out on a treadmill next to her in a gym. “He offered me a role. I had just seen his ‘Mixed Doubles’. I asked him his number. He said he doesn’t carry a mobile. I thought he was joking and asked him to give me a call in six weeks. He did and ‘Mithya’ happened. I have already finished two more films with him. One is Saurabh Shukla’s ‘Raat Gayi Baat Gayi’, which is about one night stands and the other is a comedy called ‘I am 24’.” She quickly clarifies that she is not 24. “It is Rajat’s character which is 42 but does everything to prove that he is 24.” The list doesn’t end here she is also working with “heavyweights” like Om Puri, Paresh Rawal and Boman Irani in “Maharathi” and has been signed a few days back for Saurabh’s next venture. One tries to suggest her that this so-called intelligent cinema can also peg you in an image, but Neha says she is conscious about it. “As long as there is a character graph, a definite beginning, middle and end and it doesn’t disappear midway, I have no issues.” Working with the likes of Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey and Rajat is considered difficult for they are spontaneous actors who improvise a lot while she has learnt on job. “Yes, I have but I remember what Priyadarshanji once told me during “Chup Chup Ke”. Acting is all about applying common sense.” Well, then for roles like Julie does one need to give this sense some rest? “Comedy requires a different approach. Julie wants to become an actress and joins this Punjabi gang from Chandigarh which ran away to Australia. She feels this is the way she will get a break one day. She keeps on delivering dialogues in daily life. For instance she calls the don: ‘Nayak nahin khalnayak hai tu’.” Despite all the welcome changes in her career, Neha stands by her famous quote: Only sex and SRK sells in Bollywood. “It is not me; the filmmakers are standing by it. They either want to cast SRK or want the heroines to look sexy.” A Delhiite, Neha graduated from Jesus and Marry College before taking the pageant route to Bollywood. ANUJ KUMAR",0

Five hundred families are still living in temporary shelters under trying conditions. The available poromboke land was either assigned or encroached upon. ""People here do not sell their land. They only buy more. I myself had to negotiate for 100 hours to get it. At last, we bought 85 acres at a cost of Rs. 6 crore from 123 persons,"" Collector Sunil Paliwal said. The officials stumbled upon a saltpan on a poromboke land at Colachel. But, it took nine months for filling up the low-lying area, conforming to the technical guidelines. In Kodimunai, over 1,000 truckloads of debris had to be removed from a rocky area to level the land. However, entrusting the construction work to non-government organisations expedited the process. ""When it came to government-funding, lot of restrictions came our way,"" a senior officer said. The first batch of houses was ready in September 2005. The local bodies took care of providing basic infrastructure such as water supply and drainage. ""By January 2007, all the affected people will be accommodated in permanent structures,"" Mr. Paliwal said. Only 500 new houses are built on fishermen's land on the coast.

Ms. Rajakumari went to the village as part of a team appointed by the TDP to inquire into alleged irregularities in payment of wages to workers under National Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme (NRLEGP). Other members of the team were two MLAs - Hemalata (Satyavedu) and Lalitakumar (S Kota) and two MLCs – Y.B. Rajendra Prasad and Siddha Raghava Rao. Even as the team members were examining the job cards at the panchayat office, Congress workers mobbed them and picked up a row with Ms. Rajakumari and hauled her up for making ‘derogatory remarks’ against the Daggubati couple some time ago. The wordy duel soon turned violent with Congress workers pushing and pulling Ms. Rajakumari. Some others pelted stones in which Ms. Rajakumari’s gunman sustained bleeding injury on his head. In the melee, Ms. Rajakumari lost her consciousness. The TDP leaders were aghast over the developments. Satyavedu MLA Hemalata made good her escape. When they regained their wits, they took Ms. Rajakumari in a car to Chirala for medical help. ‘Attack motivated’ Speaking to The Hindu over telephone from her hospital bed, Ms. Rajakumari said it was a clear attempt on her life. She held the Daggubati couple responsible for the ugly incidents. Saying that the attack was planned and motivated, she demanded Dr. Venkateswara Rao to resign his Assembly membership and sought an apology from Ms. Purandeswari. She also asked the Congress to take action against Dr. Venkateswara Rao and put an end to his “murderous” politics.

I saw a girl running up and down the stadium’s steps. She was hardly 16 or 17 and not a Communist Party cadre. She was running up to talk to the people and coming down to have a word with the top leaders of the party, even cracking jokes with them,” Ashok Mitra, writer and former Finance Minister of West Bengal, said, adding that what he saw underscored one of Fidel Castro’s primary achievements. Castro’s achievements “In country after country, socialists pledged to reduce the gap between the leaders and the led. But Cuba achieved it under Fidel Castro,” said the octogenarian writer, a big admirer of Castro and Cuba. However, Mr. Mitra never met Castro, not even when the Cuban leader visited Kolkata in 1973, and rather wrote an acerbic piece, A Revolutionary Handshake . “Fifty years ago, what Washington dictated was mutely obeyed by the pack of Latin American countries, mostly ruled by military generals. Fidel changed this scenario. He managed to instil a pride among the Latin American countries. The fact that the U.S. is getting edged out [today] in Latin America, failing to revive old capitalist order, is largely due to Castro,” he said. There was a rigid Soviet line — “even among Indian Communists” — which was not impressed by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong’s revolution. “Mao took a dig at Marx. Marx assumed revolution can only take place when a state reaches a certain maturity,” Mr. Mitra said. “But Mao demonstrated that those described as ‘a sack of potatoes’ — the peasantry — could be mobilised for social revolution and similar events unfolded in Cuba.” When Castro initiated his movement and moved to the mountains, he was severely criticized by the Cuban Communists for his “infantile venture”. “But as Castro emerged successful, it was these leaders who surrendered [to Castro] and this was a huge achievement in 1950s Cuba,” said Mr. Mitra. The other aspect is the influence of Castro on the social and cultural scene of South America and the world. “Even [late Colombian writer] Gabriel García Márquez publicly said his great inspiration was Castro. But, as Mao said, it takes a millennium to judge a phenomenon … it would take many years to understand and analyse Fidel Castro,” the veteran Marxist said.",0

The Department of Animal Husbandry (DAH) launched the drought mitigation fodder development project in June and succeeded in motivating more than 1,400 livestock holders to cultivate the sorghum variety of green fodder on 1,000 acres of their irrigated lands. Now, the DAH is looking forward to gather 10,000 tonnes of green fodder in the next ten days. National Seeds Corporation “We could achieve the milestone and record production, thanks to Collector V.Rajaraman, who helped procure seeds from the Delhi-based National Seeds Corporation (NSC) on time, and five spells of rain since the onset of the southwest monsoon,” said S.Balakrishnan, Joint Director, DAH, Sivaganga. Farmers with land holdings of 0.5 acre to 5 acres and a herd size of 3 to 7 milch cows were roped in to cultivate the fodder after being given seeds at 50 per cent subsidised rate and having to bear half the production cost, he said. As the growth was healthy in all the fields in Kalaiyarkoil, Sivaganga, Singampunari, S Pudur and Thirupuvanam areas “we are confident of achieving the target of 10,000 tonnes,” he said. Mr. Balakrishnan said 50 per cent of the total production would be procured for to the members of milk producers’ cooperative societies at 50 per cent subsidised rate. The rate of the fodder would be decided by a committee, headed by the Collector, he said. The livestock holders have 6,800 milch cows, and the members of the societies 750 to 800. The milk production stood at 51,000 litres a day. The supply of green fodder is expected to raise the milk output by 1,000 litres a day, he estimates. During the ensuing winter season, the department has proposed to cultivate three varieties of green fodder – sorghum and cowpea on about 300 acres and Co4 on 200 acres – under the Accelerated fodder development and State Fodder development schemes, he said. While sorghum and cowpea were meant for single cutting, Co4, which would be ready for cutting after 90 days, was meant for four cuttings a year. The farmers would be given seeds of sorghum and cowpea and seedlings of Co4 from the Government Chettinad farm shortly at subsidised rates, he said. The department will also distribute one lakh seedlings of ""Agathi Keerai"" to farmers in Sivaganga, Theni, Madurai, Dindigul and Ramanathapuram districts free of cost. The government has allocated a sum of Rs. 16 lakh for this purpose, he said. Mr. Balakrishnan said the fodder development project was launched to motivate farmers to cultivate green fodder, maintain their livestock in good health and increase milk production. The problem of fodder shortage could be addressed if the farmers were encouraged to cultivate green fodder throughout the year, he suggested.",0

Make copies of it and leave them with friends or relatives with your passport number, name, contacts of people and hotels you are visiting.

Pack right: Plan your holiday in such a way that you do not pack in too much. Comfortable shoes are a must. Make sure your hand baggage has a spare set of clothes, just in case the rest of your baggage is misplaced. Don't forget medicines: Ensure you take your medication along. Carry copies of your prescriptions as well as the generic names of the medicines you take. A letter from your doctor explaining your medical condition would be a great help too. If you wear glasses, take a spare pair and make sure you have enough spare cells for your hearing aid. If you are allergic to any particular medication or food, etc, then write that down and carry it in your person so that in case you are not in a position to speak the person attending to you is in the loop about everything.

In New Zealand, where most of the seven venues are compact and informal, officials have been quick to praise the party atmosphere, helped by a brewery offering $ (NZ) 1 million ($745,000) to be shared among fans who take a clean one-handed catch while wearing the sponsor’s T-shirt. Christchurch’s scheduled three games have now been and gone, but the city relished hosting a global sports festival for the first time since being devastated by an earthquake. Canterbury Cricket chief executive Lee Germon, the driving force behind the purpose-built Hagley Oval which replaced the destroyed former home of cricket in Christchurch, Lancaster Park, said it wSas a significant time for the city. “It’s really important that the youngsters are able to see their heroes playing here again,” he said. At sleepy, picturesque Nelson, students of 1960s and 1970s pop music were being catered for. On the playlist for the West Indies’ defeat by Ireland and Zimbabwe’s victory over the United Arab Emirates were Pink Floyd’s Us and Them , The Monkees’ I’m a Believer and, oddly, disgraced British glam-rocker Gary Glitter’s Rock and Roll (Part 1 and 2). Those music bombs which punctuate intervals between overs are a deliberate eclectic mix, according to the International Cricket Council. Sometimes instructions issued from the ICC don’t always filter down to the smaller host venues. In Nelson, a juice stall operator was given permission to sell drinks at the Ireland-West Indies game only to turn up on the day to be told her drinks were banned because Pepsi was an official sponsor. Over in Australia, meanwhile, officials at the Adelaide Oval were worried when the capacity of the refurbished stadium had to be reduced from 53,000 to 47,000 to accommodate black sightscreens at both ends. After all, the stadium’s first World Cup game was the highly-anticipated one between old foes India and Pakistan. But officials need not have worried. Fewer than 42,000 turned up for the game which was said to have been sold out within 20 minutes of going on sale a year ago. So whatever happened to the missing 5,000? The mystery was partly solved a day later when reports emerged that a few hundred supporters from India missed the game because their flight was held up back home due to technical failure in the aircraft. Why did they have to wait till the last-minute to reach Adelaide? One Indian fan, Ritesh Shah, who had travelled with his family from Mumbai, had an answer: “They perhaps wanted to save on hotel costs. Travel, watch match, take flight back home. They missed all the fun.” — AFP",0

Srinivas Prasad on Sunday expressed confidence that the Congress party will taste victory in 20 Legislative Council seats out of 26 for which the election is scheduled on December 27. “We are confident that the party is set to gain majority in the upper house after the election,” he said. Out of five two-member constituencies, the party is hopeful of winning one each, he said. Overcoming deficit Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Prasad said the ruling Congress does not enjoy majority in the Upper House and therefore many of the bills of the State government could not be passed in the Legislative Council. “This has become a setback and the coming election is expected to overcome the deficit in the numbers,” the Minister said. Barring Mysuru district, there is a straight fight in other constituencies. In Mysuru-Chamarajnagar local bodies’ constituency, there is a triangular fight. “However, the Congress will win the seat. The Congress candidate is a party loyalist and has experience,” Mr. Prasad said. In reply to a question, the Minister said 50 per cent of reservation for women, five–year term for gram panchayat (GP) presidents, Minister of State status to the zilla panchayat presidents, and rise in grants to GPs were among the achievements of the Congress government. “The good governance over the last two years will also work in favour of the party candidates,” he said. The Minister said 5,062 GP members out of 6,891 in 396 GPs were associated with the Congress. “Therefore, the party candidate is set to win with a huge majority in the first round itself. Moreover, out of 15 legislators in the two districts, 12 belong to the Congress. This is a plus point.” Many local bodies, including the two zilla panchayats, were under the control of the party and therefore the chances of the party’s win were bright, he argued. Minister in-charge of Mysuru district V. Srinivasa Prasad said neither the State government nor the Chief Minister or he intervened in fixing reservation to the constituencies of zilla panchayats and taluk panchayats. The reservation was most apt this time, he said. Mr. Prasad told presspersons on Sunday that the Election Commission (EC) had finalised the reservation list as per the norms and it was transparent. “I believe it is 100 per cent correct and there are no discrepancies in the reservation,” he said. In reply to a question, he said anybody could question the reservation of seats in the court and the EC would reply.

This included access to medical care for over 2,457 pregnant women, 2,539 accident cases, 739 cases of cardiac arrests, 505 police emergencies and 9 fire service needs. About 31 deliveries had taken place inside the ambulances, well equipped with the necessary logistics to ensure healthy delivery. About 368 critical lives were saved in the course of the last one year. Speaking on the occasion, Collector C.Munianathan said the service that commenced with eight ambulances last year here was increased to 11 ambulances. The objective was to reduce casualty by providing immediate medical care during first few minutes called the ‘golden hour' before the patient reached the hospital, he said. Mr.Munianathan also suggested that optimal use would be four persons for each ambulance in each block. As of now, only three persons from each block called for the facility and this could be increased. As of date, about 385 ambulances were functioning in Tamil Nadu. It has been proposed to increase the number of ambulances to 545 by 2011. Emergency Management Technicians (EMTs) were honoured with life saver awards for their dedicated services.

President of the samiti M. Madhukar Amin told presspersons here on Thursday that the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) was planning to acquire 2,035.31 acres of agricultural land in four villages in Mangalore taluk — Permude, Tenka Yekkaru, Kutthethoor and Delanthabettu. All these villages had been thriving on agriculture and there was only two-three per cent of fallow land in this cluster of villages, he said. The samiti, which has gathered opinions from landowners and farmers in the villages, has found that none of the farmer families were willing to give away their agricultural land for the proposed MSEZ. Mr. Amin said the MSEZ managing director had recently given statements in the media that only five per cent of the identified land was cultivable and the rest was fallow land and almost all farmer families had consented to give up their land. This statement was far from truth, he added. Mr. Amin said that the samiti had been incensed particularly about converting agricultural land into industrial area and displacing the farmers. He said the samiti members were feeling insecure about their future as they did not know anything else but farming. General secretary of the samiti Lawrance D’Cunha said most of the land identified for the MSEZ in these villages belonged to “Patta” category. In Permude 792.71 acres of land was in “patta” category and 82 acres was government land. In Kutthethoor 269.79 acres was “patta” land and 74.63 acres government land. In Delanthabettu 236.141 acres was “patta” land and 132.339 acres government land and in Tenka Yekkaru 446.68 acres was “patta” land and 3.02 acres was government land, he said. If these lands were to be acquired, religious shrines such as “Bootha Sthaanas”, churches, temples and “Naga banas” would be lost, Mr. D’Cunha said.

The injustice had been continued, despite drawing the attention of the Government in this regard, by way of boycotting the evaluation in April, he said. The disparity had continued ever since the recommendations of the fourth and fifth pay commissions were implemented. With the implementation of the sixth pay commission's recommendations, the disparity had increase enormously. The Government, in response to a memorandum, had constituted a committee, headed by Kumar Naik, senior officer, to study the pay scales, to which the association had given a representation mentioning about the injustice meted out to its members. The committee had submitted its report. But, so far, the Government had not taken any steps to make the recommendations public, he said. Mr. Reddy said that the association members, drawn from all over the district, would go on a mass leave on Monday, take out a rally to the Deputy Commissioner's office and submit a memorandum. Later, they would stage a dharna in front of the Deputy Commissioner's office. Announcing the recommendations of the Kumar Naik Committee report, special pay-scales to principals and promotion for lecturers of pre-university colleges were major among the demands of the association.",0

Besides an increase in the number of autorickshaw stands, the AAP - in its 70-point manifesto - had said it would facilitate quick bank loans for the purchase of autorickshaws, conduct special training for drivers, and ensure that harassment by the traffic police and transport authorities was stopped. But ask Dayal Singh, an auto driver who plies in Karol Bagh, and he says: “Nothing had changed since the AAP came into power.” “If we are caught, we are not allowed to ply our auto for a month, irrespective of the fine we pay. It is very difficult for us to maintain our families this way,” Mr. Singh said. Shankar Kumar, another auto driver, seconded this version. “There were some changes in the law because of which harassment by the Traffic Police came down. But, (transport) authority officials still don’t let drivers like me off without a bribe.” Though the AAP announced a bank loan scheme, many auto drivers claimed to have faced difficulties when it comes to taking help from banks. Other drivers, meanwhile, said that they were thankful to government organisations like Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) for schemes that came to their aid. “Schemes such as the IGL Suraksha Yojana and the IGL Swasth Saradhi have proved more helpful than the Delhi government,” said Krishna Pandey, a resident of Shahdara. Union upset The unions representing the auto drivers, meanwhile, have charged the AAP government of not delivering on demands despite several strikes. Rajendra Soni, general secretary of the Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union and Delhi Autorickshaw Sangh, alleged that the government’s bias towards app-based taxi services was evident from the fact that its norms sought to ensure that every auto driver should possess a licensed badge, which was not the case with the app-based cab drivers. He also demanded why, when the Supreme Court had granted permission for nearly 1 lakh autos to ply, only 70,000 autos were given licences by the Delhi Transport Authority. “The AAP government has increased the number of e-rickshaws just to increase its vote bank,” he alleged. Sanjay Samrat, president of the Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters Association said that both the AAP and the BJP governments were allowing app-based platforms to function despite questions over the legality of their operations. In addition to announcing its intent to formulate “holistic transport policies for all forms of transport”, the AAP had promised the establishment of a ‘Unified Transport Authority’, apart from a revision of fares. Opinion on this, however, was divided among the auto drivers. “We lose out to app-based vehicles because their base fare is Rs. 6 per kilometre while ours is Rs. 8. Fares should remain where they are, but the plying of app-based taxis must be regulated,” said Vibhuti Prasad who has been driving an auto for three decades. According to Ramesh Tiwari, another auto driver, autorickshaws cater to “specific commuters” who are more comfortable in an auto than a car. Government speak Though Transport Minister Satyendar Jain remained unavailable for a comment, a senior government official said the AAP dispensation had done a lot and was on track to do more for auto rickshaw drivers in the immediate future.

Send your queries to askshahnaz@gmail.com I have been suffering from dandruff for a long time. My scalp is also oily. — Deepthi For dandruff, apply a non-oily herbal hair tonic on the scalp daily, using cotton wool and leave it on. Part the hair into sections, and apply it on the scalp. Wash your hair with a mild herbal shampoo three or four times a week, using less shampoo and rinsing it off well with water. Half an hour before a shampoo wash, apply two tablespoons of vinegar on the scalp, massaging it lightly into the scalp. Once a week, heat olive oil or til oil, and apply it on the scalp at night. Leave it on overnight. The next morning, apply the juice of a lemon 15 minutes before a shampoo wash. Include fresh fruits, raw salads, sprouts and yogurt in your daily diet. Drink six to eight glasses of water daily. Add the juice of a lemon to a glass of water, and drink it first thing in the morning. Ask your doctor to prescribe vitamin and mineral supplements. What should I do to get rid of the fine hair growing on top of my nose? — Kannan You can have threading done, or try waxing strips. Home remedies do not remove facial hair. But they are said to lessen the growth if used regularly over a period of time. You may also try the following remedies for discouraging facial hair growth. Make a thick paste of sugar, lemon juice and water and apply it in the direction of hair growth. Wash it off after it dries. Apply it once or twice a week. Apply a paste of turmeric powder and milk and rub this on the skin using a circular motion. It is said to discourage facial hair, but it may leave a slight yellowish colour on the skin. I have whiteheads around my eyes. Suggest a remedy. — Preethivi In whiteheads, the pores are not open. They form easily where the skin is thin, like around the eyes. Avoid pinching it with your nails, as it can lead to infection. Scrubs cannot be used around the eyes, but you can try some home remedies. Make a paste of fenugreek leaves and apply it on the face daily, washing it off after an hour. Drink six to eight glasses of water daily. Add the juice of a lemon to a glass of water, and drink it first thing in the morning. Drinking barley water is also said to help prevent whiteheads. I have warts on my face. What should I do remove them? — Mohammed Rafi Warts are small, hard, uneven, raised growths, with a rough surface. They can appear on the face and different parts of the body. Some warts are caused by a virus and spread easily. It is best to refer your problem to a dermatologist, or try homeopathic treatment. As far as home remedies are concerned, it is said that applying vinegar on the warts daily causes them to finally fall out. Apply it only on the wart, using cotton wool. I have thin eyebrows. Suggest what I should to make them thick. — Nandhini Apply a little castor oil daily on your eyebrows, using a cotton bud. Meanwhile, you can also make the eyebrows appear thicker with the help of make-up. Using an eyebrow pencil, make short feathery strokes on the brows. Avoid dark lines. My skin is oily and pimple-prone. My face also becomes dry after I wash it in winter. Suggest what kind of moisturiser I should apply and when. — Lakshmi Use a face wash for oily skin, or a mild glycerine soap during winter. Dryness during winter for someone with oily skin is superficial dryness of the outermost layer of the skin. Apply a light moisturising lotion. Or, mix one teaspoon of pure glycerine with 100 ml of rose water. Store it in an airtight bottle. Apply a little of this lotion daily to relieve dryness. It may be applied after washing your face.",0

There is no evidence that they receive money or weapons from China — China as a country or China as an entity. Weapons are indeed smuggled from across the border — both the Bangladesh border and the Myanmar border.” Mr. Chidambaram also pointed out that the CPI (Maoist) was able to raise funds within the country. “They are able to raise money through extortion, through levies, and through looting. But we are keeping a careful watch. If there is any evidence that they receive money or receive other support from any organisation abroad, certainly, we shall look into the matter very carefully and, with the help of friendly countries, take action against those organisations which are reported to be supporting the CPI (Maoist).”",1

If the strike prolongs, nearly 50 buses need to be brought in from main depots like Thiruvananthapuram to operate buses to different parts of the district, Mr. Stanley said. Talks fail The indefinite strike will continue as the meeting convened by District Collector M. Beena to end the private bus strike failed to reach a consensus. While the workers stuck to their demand of implementing fair wages within 45 days, the bus owners refused to hike the wages. The worker said that since owners of 103 buses agreed to implement fair wages, these buses would operate.",1

Led by the Radhapuram union secretary of Tamil Nadu Nadar Paeravai, Senthil Murugan, the palmyrah workers and the supporters of Akhila India Samaththuva Makkal Katchi took out a rally from Kalvilai to the nearby palmgrove and tapped toddy. Raising slogans against the State Government’s ban on toddy tapping, which was later upheld by the Supreme Court, some protestors drank toddy and certified that it was only a health drink with insignificant alcohol content and not an alcoholic beverage like the brew being sold in the IMFL outlets of the State Government. Similarly, some palmyrah farmers tapped toddy at Pattankaadu even as the police arrested 517 protestors, including 66 women, in the neighbouring town of Vasudevanallur. The police also arrested 79 persons at Surandai and 80 others at Paavoorchathram when they tried to tap toddy. Virudhunagar Hundreds of members of the Tamil Nadu Nadar Peravai and a few cadres of All India Moovendar Munnani Kazhagam were arrested at different places in the district on Wednesday when they proceeded to tap toddy. All those arrested were released later in the day. At Virudhunagar, the peravai’s district president, K.G.N. Kanagarathinam, who led the protest, flayed the successive State governments which promised to allow toddy tapping before elections and reversed their decision after coming to power. “When toddy tapping is allowed by the governments in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Union territory of Puducherry, why is it not permitted in Tamil Nadu alone,” Mr. Kanagarathinam asked. He wondered what the prohibition policy of the State Government was that permitted sale of Indian-made foreign liquor through TASMAC shops, but banned toddy tapping. “Toddy has less alcohol content when compared to IMFL. Either, the Government should impose total prohibition by closing all TASMAC shops or allow tapping of toddy,” he said. A huge posse of policemen present at the venue prevented the peravai members from taking out a procession to a nearby palm groove to tap toddy. Protests were held at various places in and around Srivilliputtur taluk. An effigy of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president, K.V. Thangakabalu was burnt near the Mariamman Teppakulam near here by three cadres of the peravai, the police said. Ramanathapuram More than 2000 persons, including 949 women, were arrested on Wednesday when they attempted to tap toddy at various places in the district. They were demanding the government to permit toddy tapping. In most of the places, the police prevented their attempt when they assembled for the agitation. In Paramakudi, 422 persons were arrested, including Muniasamy, president, Tamil Nadu Palm Tree Workers Association. A similar agitation was carried out Thamaraikulam, Vannankundu, Uppur, Puduvalasai and others. All were released in the evening. Sivaganga In Sivaganga district, 313 persons were arrested while they attempted to stage similar kind of protest at Ilayankudi and Devakottai.",1

I step into Life and am pulled into a world reminiscent of kalaris and tharavadus. It isn’t the buildings but the feel of the place that conjures up the images in my mind. I’m here, at the family-owned health centre (run by Yogaratna K. P. Baskara Menon, called Ashaan by students, and his four sons), to try my hand at yoga. The greenery, the people, the natural pond (move overmodern swimming pools!) and lingering scent of frankincense, tips the scales in favour of this place and I’m convinced that I’m going to enjoy my session. I wasn’t wrong! I’m led to the yoga centre and turned over to the head of the family and yoga master. Ashaan says that yoga has innumerable benefits and the practice depends on the physique and physical condition of the person. “In yoga, one does not look on a problem as a sickness/disease of the body, but as a mechanical trouble,” he says and the purpose is to ensure “the passage of air through the nostrils to every atom and molecule in the body so that they can do they allotted job well and naturally.” Before the session kicks off I’m asked to offer a silent prayer. Ashaan shows me the first of the breathing exercises, with which every yoga session commences. I bring my heels together with my feet spaced apart and away from each other. I breathe in deeply and simultaneously lift my hands away from my sides to bring it together above my head, while I rise and balance on my toes. This exercise causes my ribcage to expand giving my lungs more space ‘to breathe. Ashaan asks me to do a set of ten before continuing to the next three exercises (I do sets of ten of those as well). Now that I’ve warmed up, I’m ready to graduate to the asanas! I sit on the floor, upright, feet tucked completely under me, my weight balanced on the soles of my feet and there I was performing Vajrasana. Of course, I feel a sense of accomplishment and am eager to try the next one - Leghu Pavanamukthasan. I lie flat on my back and bring one bent leg (and then the next) up to my chest and my jaw forward to touch the knee, while controlling my breath. I do this asanas ten times. My next challenge was the Nakrasana and I wrapped for the day with the Pavanamukthasana. I walked away on my steam, without the usual bonus of aches after a workout, but with the realisation that yoga is an experience to be savoured! Bottomline: Rejuvenating, relaxing and uplifting! Life is situated on Changampuzha Road, Edappally. In addition to the Yoga Centre, they have Health Clubs (separate for men and women), an ayurvedic massage centre and offer swimming classes.

Patients complain that though December 1 is remembered as World Aids Day, little is done by the government or society to understand their living conditions, with focus being given to disease awareness, prevention and control. Government organisations offering services to the PLWHA community exist like ‘Jyothis’ which conducts free HIV tests; ‘Ushus’ also known as Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre where ART drugs are distributed; ‘Sneha’ to prevent the spread of HIV from mother to infant during pregnancy; ‘Pulari’ - a treatment centre for sexually transmitted diseases; and Prathyasha - a service agency serving as peer counselling centre. However, activists working with AIDS patients say that a number of components are missing in the government’s AIDS policy. A government initiative to help these patients by providing free rations and find jobs and a rehabilitation centre for patients thrown out of homes to stay permanently are some of the demands that, they say, have been continuously placed before lawmakers. P. Kumar, vice-president of the Council of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Kerala (CPK+) and a volunteer at the Kozhikode Medical College ward and the ART Centre, said improvements had been made in availability of treatment and distribution of medicines. “But the lack of permanent doctors at the ward and the relegation of these patients from ward 26, which could house 40 patients, to ward 43 which has just eight beds have affected treatment facilities,” Mr.Kumar said. Prathyasha counsels more than 275 AIDS patients, most of whom are destitute. They approach the staff at the centre with requests for money, food and jobs besides counselling but the government only foots the rent bill and the salary for the staff. The centre helps them through food kits sponsored by NGOs like the Centre for Overall Development, Thamarassery. Mr. Kumar said there could be more HIV patients in north Kerala beyond the 3,000 registered at the ART centre. Many keep the knowledge of the illness secret for fear of ostracisation, some are ignorant that they carry the illness while others are affluent enough to seek treatment at private hospitals. “Most AIDS patients live lonely, fearful lives. Coming to a centre like Prathyasha opens them to others who face the same problems, yet get emotional and physical support to lead normal lives. The government should launch more outreach services for HIV affected persons through Prathyasha centres,” Mr. Kumar said.",0

Writer, director and producer Janardhan Maharshi uses senior citizens and stalwarts like K. Viswanath and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam to run a human drama with a light hearted approach but towards the end of the film, it brings a lump in your throat without being a deliberate tear jerker — just an unexpected yet perfect fit. The performances are so astounding that it is difficult to point out who's the best out of the duo. While Viswanath is subtle, underplays his role, speaks volumes through his smiles, nods, indifference and tears. S. P. B. on the other hand is a live wire, gregarious but balanced. Both of them complement each other. They bring out the huge difference in their thinking, attitude and approach towards life. The prelude says: For Srimannarayana (K.Viswanath) a temple is his home, but for Sambasiva (S. P. B.), a home is as good as a temple. One thinks that whatever the birth, the living is important and one should serve humanity and return this body to God in a pure form as pure as he was when he was born. The other is selfish and refuses to think about a third person other than himself and his wife. The first half of the film dwells on the budding friendship between the two strangers. Two different types of people and post the interval, the director focuses on the larger society. KV's dry sense of humour comes out through his witty one liners. His dialogues are full of pathos; his actions and songs range from politics, terrorism, civic sense, death and shine like pearls of wisdom, sans the preaching. Each scene is laden with wonderful lines and when the director falls short of them, he uses the visual to convey it perfectly. Aamani makes a fresh beginning and illuminates the screen with her presence. Janardhan Maharshi's casting is perfect. While the trio run the entire show, Kovai Sarala provides the comic relief. The film is worth watching for its strong performances, some crackling writing and a noble ambition. The length of the film is just right; it never loses its emotional momentum and maintains clarity in dialogues throughout. Devasthanam is a re-invention of octogenarian K.Viswanath. He is back in his element, warm, empathetic and in full authority of his character. S. P. B. is the common man's alter ego and the film is sure to fetch a bag of encomiums. y. sunita chowdhary",0

This assumes significance in light of the unsolicited expression of interest from India’s largest low-cost airline IndiGo for taking over Air India. While Indigo has appeared keen to acquire a stake in Air India, the airline has said it would not be prepared to bear the state-owned carrier’s unsustainable liabilities. Air India has total debt of about Rs. 52,000 crore, comprising of Rs. 22,000 crore as aircraft loans and the rest as working capital loans and other liabilities. Air India has financed working capital through borrowings from a consortium of 25 banks. “The new owner will take the airline’s reasonable working capital of around Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000 crore,” another official said on condition of anonymity. Primary interest IndiGo’s President and Whole-Time Director Aditya Ghosh told the budget airline’s employees in a letter last week: “Our interest in Air India is primarily in its international operations… In that journey, we are not going to take on debts and liabilities that could not be supported by the new restructured operations.” Air India’s prime real estate properties spread across the country and abroad may not be a part of its stake sale process, the senior aviation ministry official said, adding that its aircraft, parking and landing slots, international air traffic rights, human resources would go under the hammer. The privatisation process would not impact the national carrier’s air services agreements till the time substantial ownership and effective control vests with a domestic owner, the official added. “Air India’s real estate, including land and buildings, and art treasures may not be a part of the disinvestment process. It may be hived off to a shell company,” the official said. Some of its prime real estate properties include a building at Nariman Point and another at the old airport in Santa Cruz, both in Mumbai, freehold land in Chennai’s Annasalai, an office in Baba Kharak Singh Marg, Connaught Place, New Delhi, and freehold land and buildings in Hyderabad. However, the airline has placed some of these as security with banks for availing loans. As per its turnaround and restructuring plan approved in 2012, Air India is required to monetise its assets in India and globally and generate Rs. 5,000 crore through sale, lease or developing assets as joint ventures over a period of 10 years. In 2015-16, Air India earned about Rs. 90 crore from monetisation of assets as per provisional estimates. The Cabinet last week approved in-principle the strategic disinvestment of Air India and formed a group of Ministers to examine modalities of the stake sale, including selling the subsidiaries and restructuring its debts.",0

Eleven Central trade unions have called it and 5,324 unaffiliated trade unions have issued strike notices in support,” Mr. Dasgupta, who is also a senior leader and MP of the Communist Party of India, told journalists.

Antony has said that the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) will not be successful in its schemes to cover up its failures through anti-Centre rhetoric and agitations. Mr. Antony made these observations in a reference to the anti-Centre agitations being planned by the LDF Government, during the inaugural address at a district-level camp for ward presidents of the Congress here on Sunday. “If bitter factional feuds in your party have brought the State Government to a standstill, you must identify the problems within yourselves and resolve them. You can’t evade responsibility for the crisis in the State by blaming the Centre for everything. This Central Government has been the most sympathetic and helpful one to the people of Kerala. Barring some issues involving inter-State disputes, the Centre has been lenient to the demands of the State during the last three years.” “Numerous schemes have been sanctioned to the State by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government during the last three years. Whether the State Government had been able to make use of them is a different question. But it will be unjust to blame the Centre for the present problems in the State,” he said. Mr. Antony said the LDF leadership in the State must realise that under the present situation in the country it would be difficult for any party to dictatorially enforce its policies and programmes on the people just because it enjoyed majority in the State Assembly. Other arms of democracy like judiciary and the media are now poised to make strong interventions. If the rulers try to be dictatorial, their case will be dismissed by the people’s court. The LDF leadership should not think that they can revert back to their old dangerous style of ‘carrying power and struggle together.’ He reminded his own party activists that they should not be in haste to recapture the power they had lost in the last Assembly elections. They should remember that they have to wait for five years as the present rulers can continue to be in power as long as they enjoyed majority in the Assembly. Criticising LDF leaders for their complaints against the Congress in the State — that it was trying to launch continuous agitations against the (LDF) Government — Mr. Antony said they must introspect and find out how they had behaved as an Opposition in the past.

But the facts of the event belied all wrong notions and negative vibes passed into the oblivion as the sammelan became a success, though adversaries kept on threatening to spoil the show over one or the other pretext. There were many minor lacunae, of course. They pertained to food and its quality, accommodation, difficulty in reaching the venue, the Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa College grounds, choked toilets, and the biting cold in evenings. However, many were of the opinion that ‘everything was good’ since a tiny place such as Madikeri was hosting the show. Lots of dust flying in the air at the venue made many sick. The threat by a committee formed by citizens to oppose the K. Kasturirangan Committee report on western ghats in Kodagu to observe a bandh on January 7 dissipated after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah assured a delegation of the committee to look into the issue. A group of people who wanted the president of the sammelan Na. D’Souza to tender apologies for his remarks on the Kasturirangan committee report had even succeeded in reaching the dais. But, Mr. D’Souza stated he did not issue any statement supporting the implementation of the report in Kodagu. The group opposing previous sammelan president Ko. Chennabasappa’s book glorifying Tipu and the other supporting the book too had threatened to spoil the show. Statements of the Central Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Bangalore, Pundalika Halambi, created a sensation when he accounted for the curtailment of the speech of Mr. D’Souza, but he later apologised. Short-circuit causing fire when a particular session was on created a minor scare after which the fire was doused in time. The small or narrow roads of Madikeri looked as if they were unable to ‘bear the load’ of people who walked from the Maitree Police Hall junction to the venue, while vehicles with official passes scrambled along precariously avoiding the surging crowd. Locals were seen thronging book stalls and participating in the evening cultural programmes. They reaffirmed their faith in dance and music as they would do during the famous Madikeri Dasara festivities. Policemen had a tough job in controlling the crowd, indulging in verbal duels with people. However, not much was done by them when hundreds of government employees, including teachers, played spoilsport close to the dais on all three days of the sammelan, shouting slogans demanding OOD coupons to claim the benefits while they went back to their respective workplaces. A large number of visitors empathised with the organisers.",0

There was nothing to substantiate the allegations against her,” an ACB official said. The alleged scam was flagged by the Congress and the NCP against the BJP-led government headed by Devendra Fadnavis. Reacting to the development, Ms. Munde, daughter of late BJP stalwart Gopinath Munde, said the allegations were part of a plan to defame her. “I had said many times that there was no substance in the allegations. On several occasions in the Legislative Assembly also, I have replied to the charges,” she said. “The ACB has given me a clean chit. I am absolved of the charges.

Ms. Munde had rubbished the charges and said she was prepared for any inquiry. “This is a scam of words. The allegations against me are politically motivated,” she had said. She had claimed that the previous Congress-NCP government had purchased similar items at a cost of Rs. 408 crore.

There has always been a demand for more trains not only to Chennai but also other parts of the country. Another eleven weekly trains, also pass via Tiruchi giving connectivity to Chennai, Tirupathi and some North Indian destinations. These trains enjoy good patronage and there have been consistent pleas to make them either regular services or increase their frequency. The north bound weekly trains either departing or passing via Tiruchi are Tiruchi – Howrah bi-weekly express (on the chord line); Kanyakumari – Howrah weekly express (chord line); Madurai – Hazrath Nizamuddin Sampark Kranti bi-weekly express (chord line); Tiruneveli – Jammu Tawi bi-weekly link express (via Karur, Erode); Nagercoil – Mumbai CST bi-weekly express (chord line via Chengulpet); Rameshwaram – Bhubaneswar weekly express (main line), Rameshwaram – Varanasi weekly express (main line); Madurai – Tirupathi bi-weekly express (main line); Madurai – Chennai bi-weekly express (main line); Nagercoil – Chennai weekly express (via Karur,Erode) and Nagercoil – Chennai weekly express (chord line). The Madurai – Tirupathi bi-weekly express, introduced a few months ago, serves the travelling public of both southern and central districts well. Travellers feel that the Railway should take steps for converting this train into a regular service. This move will immensely benefit senior citizens and women. Travellers also point out that there was a daily train service between Maduai and Tirupathi before the meter gauge main line was closed for conversion into broad guage. The Railway assured to restore all trains which were running on the main line after the completion of gauge conversion. It is high time it is made a daily service, they say.

Women, especially those who are post-menopausal, should take steps to avoid osteoporosis, that is, a condition in which bones become more porous. As women grow old, the quality of the bones starts declining and they become more vulnerable to fractures. Bone formation and bone breakage takes place in all people but in post-menopausal women, the bone formation reduces and breakage is more, says a senior resident doctor at Wenlock Hospital. To counter the effect of osteoporosis, women may be prescribed vitamins, calcium supplements, and certain other drugs. Once medicines are prescribed, women must take them regularly. However, not all women require medicines. Those who are active may not have the problem, she says. Some people with musculo-skeletal pain take a treatment that excludes medicines. One elderly woman, for instance, takes hot packs for her neck pain. She avoids taking medicines as she does not want its side-effects. When there is an option (of not taking medicines), why not take it is her argument. Another patient says he finds breathing exercises and stretches (done under the guidance of doctors) very good for his back pain. He also does not take any medicine. Narasimman S., Professor and Head, Department of Physiotherapy, Father Muller Medical College, says that certain problems, not all, can be managed without medicines. If a problem is not severe, then medicines need not be given. It is all need-based, he says. A senior resident doctor at Wenlock Hospital says that diagnosis is a must. Assessing the problem is important and there is no blanket approach to every case. For instance, backaches can be due to various causes. Applying heat is no problem in 80 per cent of the cases. But in 20 per cent of the cases, the problem may flare up. “We give painkillers but with these, the lesser the better. So if the pain reduces, we tell the patient not to take medicines,” she said.",0

Venkatesan New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to restrain the Gujarat government from circulating, publishing and acting on the Nanavati Commission report on the Godhra train carnage. (The commission, appointed by the State government, said the February 27, 2002 fire aboard coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express at the Godhra station was a “pre-planned conspiracy by local Muslims.”) A Bench, consisting of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice P. Sathasivam, however, issued notice to the government on a special leave petition filed by Citizens for Justice and Peace against a Gujarat High Court order refusing to pass an interim order restraining it from placing the report in the Assembly. Senior counsel Rajinder Sachar said there was no provision under law for a commission to submit an interim report particularly when there were several terms of reference. He said the High Court earlier restrained the tabling of the Justice Banerjee Committee report on the same issue in Parliament. (The Banerjee Committee, appointed by Railway Minister Lalu Prasad, said the fire was “purely accidental.”) Mr. Sachar argued that the Nanavati Commission had named the conspirators and if the government arrested them, communal harmony would be distrubed. When Justice Balakrishnan asked counsel whether the commission had given any specific direction to the government or recommendations for implementation of the report, Mr. Sachar said “We have not gone through the report.” Justice Balakrishnan said: “It would not be possible to pass an interim order without hearing the Gujarat government.” The Bench then posted the matter to October 13. The petitioner said tabling one part of the Nanavati report and making it public was detrimental to the public interest. It questioned the commission’s action in withholding the report on the “dubious role” of the State government in supporting the accused involved in the carnage against the minority community, which followed the train fire.",1

Those yellow, round, goggled, high-pitched, rambunctious little beings — Minions. Introduced to the world through the 2010 animation film Despicable Me, these creatures now have a following of their own with their latest movie Minions that hit the screens last Friday. Clothes, socks, lip gloss, cereals, car stickers, decals for keyboards, phone cases, laptop sleeves, mugs, cushions, pen drives, themes for bedrooms and parties, cakes and cupcakes, sanitary napkins even. Believe it or not, Pantone, the international organisation that decides the colour of the year has now released a Minion Yellow. They describe it as the “colour of hope, joy and optimism.” This is the first time the organisation has named a colour after a character from a film: proof that pop-culture often has its say in the world of fashion, and so it is time to revel with this squeaky yellow lot as they dazzle in their moment in the spotlight. Toys It’s a sea of yellow at Hamleys. The Minions have taken over a section of the store. Toys in various sizes and with various mechanisms amuse kids and adults alike. The store has always stocked toys from the movie franchise. Last week, they introduced a collection of new toys to coincide with the release of the film, and so far, 36 pieces have been sold. Micro Minions, small action figures, musical ones that make funny sounds and fart blasters (as the name suggests, it makes relevant sounds and is a super hit with the little ones apparently). “The percentage of grown-ups buying Minion toys are higher than kids. Bob and Stuart are popular among the 25 year olds,” says Antony, retail sales executive, Hamleys. And if you want the soft cuddly ones, eBay and Amazon have just that, along with badges, school/lunch bags, goggles and helmets. Clothes and accessories At the premiere of Minions , Sandra Bullock walked the red carpet in a pair of yellow, Minion-inspired heels designed by Rupert Sanderson. Too bad we can’t get Sanderson to custom design shoes for us, but what we can do is grab a pair of those shoes on selfridges.com. The store and the website also stock a special line created by designers Giles Deacon, Piers Atkinson and Sanderson. Titled the Bello Yellow Collection, it has sequined outfits, silk dresses, sweatshirts, head gears, denim shirts and T-shirts. For matching footwear, there are designers and artists who hand-paint shoes, like Shailee’s Custom Painted Shoes and Tees, a page on Facebook, which specialises in Minion-themed canvas footwear. Apart from sneakers and slip ons, Fashionara.com has nude pumps with Minions in different avatars on them. Printed T-shirts are perhaps the simplest way to wear your Minion on your sleeve. Or you can team up a blue dungaree with a yellow top just like your favourite unicellular beings. Hoodies, suspenders, hats, hair bands, baby shoes, woollen socks, cushioned flip flops and beanies are the other preferred themed accessories. And for fans of spoofs, ultykhopdi.com has T-shirts with Gabbar, Wolverine, the gang from Big Bang Theory — all Minion-fied. Nails Pinterest is buzzing with thousands of nail art pictures inspired by the Minions. Wouldn’t you want that cheerful yellow with faces of one or two-eyed characters on your nails? Just looking at them can brighten your day. If you can’t get salons to do it for you, YouTube has a few tutorial videos that demonstrate how to get it right. Or the easier way out would be to invest in nail stickers which are available on online portals like Aliexpress.com. Parties Theme parties are fun. But sometimes, coming up with an idea that has a universal appeal can be a task. Minions seem to have takers across all age groups. Right from Halloween costumes to birthday outfits, people love experimenting with this theme. Vandana Mahtani of Lloyd’s Tea House says, “We receive quite a few orders for Minion cakes and cupcakes. In the last two months, we have catered to around 16 such orders for cupcakes alone.” The latest party that she catered to had a dessert table full of goodies inspired by the movie. Cookies, mousse, macaroons and cake pops were part of the menu and all stuck to the blue and yellow colour scheme. Minion Yellow is described by Pantone as the “colour of hope, joy and optimism.”",0

""Cyprus is the worst country in Europe for the number of birds killed,"" said Andrea Rutigliano of the Bonn-based Committee Against Bird Slaughter (CABS). Blackcaps, thrushes and other songbirds face a high-risk passage through the island despite tough prison terms and fines for poachers. Cooked up in restaurants as a prized if illegal delicacy known as ambelopoulia, they are served ""under the table"", and a typical plate of a dozen birds costs between 40 and 80 euros ($55 and $110). How are they trapped? The poachers traditionally use nets and limesticks -- twigs covered in a sticky substance that instantly trap birds that alight on them, leaving them to dangle helplessly -- and speakers that emit the call of blackcaps to attract their prey. During the peak season in autumn, 3,000 to 4,000 poachers take to the woods and hills of Cyprus, according to CABS. The spring migration season draws lower numbers because the birds are less plump. ""The situation is very worrying -- it's actually getting worse,"" said Martin Hellicar of the association BirdLife Cyprus. But Hellicar said the activity has made a strong comeback over the past seven years, with some 150 species affected indiscriminately, including a number already threatened with extinction. On paper Ecologists say the situation is worst on the British sovereign bases, a hangover from the colonial era that ended with Cyprus's independence in 1960. Prince Charles, himself a keen conservationist, wrote to President Nicos Anastasiades and the commander of the British military on the island to condemn the ""industrial-scale killing"" of birds. ""We prosecute about 200 cases a year, more than that, and each case can be more than one person. We have vigorous campaigns,"" said Game and Fauna Service head Pantelis Hajiyerou. ""There is a major decrease"" in trapping in government-controlled Cyprus ""but an increase in the (British) bases,"" he said. Hajiyerou said plans are being drawn up for a ""holistic approach on the poaching problem"", including education on the island where tradition is all-important and 90 percent of people ""don't think it's wrong to eat ambelopoulia"". BirdLife Cyprus said that the law -- ""on paper"" -- provides for hefty penalties of up to three years behind bars and fines as high as 17,000 euros. But the sentences passed so far have been a few hundred euros in fines, serving as ""no deterrent at all"", Hellicar said.AFP Ambelopoulia is a controversial dish of grilled, pickled or boiled songbirds. It is illegal in Cyprus as it involves trapping wild birds such as Blackcaps and European Robins. The trappers defend their activity by citing the practice as traditional Cypriot food gathering and historically this has been an important source of protein for the natives Birdlife Cyprus has identified restaurants as the main culprits as they provide the financial incentives",0

Son of Mohan Veena maestro and India's Grammy Award winner Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, he has received a Pre-Grammy Award nomination which speaks volumes of his highly successful international collaborations. Salil is also the first musician to perform in Parliament of Germany. His flamboyant choice in clothes can make many wonder; his appetite for stage performances might amuse others but when he sits and strings his instrument all are but lost in the mellifluous tunes. Recently he got Sangeet Bhushan award for his contribution to the classical music world. Here he talks about his creation, his legendary father and his award. Excerpts from an interview: Tell us about your creation Satvik veena? My father created Mohan veena approximately half-a-entury ago. My creation is heavily influenced by his and also the Hawaiian guitar. You can say it’s a cross between them. People have this misconception that guitar is a western instrument but it is not so. The oldest string instrument to exist ever was ‘Shat-Tantra Veena’ or a Veena with hundred strings now commonly known as Santoor. From it all other string instruments evolved, be it the Swar Mandal, or my father’s Mohan Veena and for that matter my own Satvik Veena. Every artist should play an instrument which suits his personality; hence I created Satvik Veena almost a couple of decades back. What is the difference between Mohan Veena and Satvik Veena? Both are different in their structure. Tuning is different. The kind of wood used for creating either of them is different hence the resonance emitted is different too. Your father has also been your guru. Please enlighten us about the kind of relation you share with him. Having a Grammy Award winner as my father and guru was a blessing for me but also daunting at times. Though he never pushed me into music, it naturally happened. He never asked me to sit with him and learn but since I guess it’s in our blood I felt guilty at not learning enough and that made me work hard and learn better. He was always supportive but because of all his tours and concerts he never had time. So I literally had to fight against time to get the right directions from him. For a musician what hold more importance: performing and getting firsthand experience on stage or sitting with the guru and doing one’s riyaz? Riyaz is a very tiny word to describe what we go through to appear on stage and perform. What we do is a sadhna, a tapasya! I think both the scenarios hold relevance for different people and different situations. Getting solid knowledge from one’s guru is of utmost importance. But now since I have to travel so much for my concerts, I rarely do get time to sit with my father. It’s a part and parcel of a musician’s life. It’s all a part of the ‘sadhana’ we are doing. Tell us about the recent award you got and how much do these awards mean to an artist? I was bestowed with the title of ‘Sangeet Bhushan’ in the 2nd Sangeet Triveni Festival held in New Delhi recently. Vidushi Shanno Khurana ji gave me this award. And I think for me or any artist these awards are a medium of appreciation people show towards us and therefore I accept them with open arms and a bowed head in reverence. What is the one advice you would want to give aspiring musicians? There is nothing called instant gratification in the world of classical music. Parents come to me after one month and ask when their child will perform on stage! Music should never be learnt with this bent of mind for when we go on stage we aren’t showing off our skills but recreating our thousand-year-old traditions. People are awed by the aplomb when they see us perform but don’t think about the broken backs we’ve had from continuous practice! So what I have to say is learn well, have a solid repertoire, and then maybe think of getting on stage. Parents come to me after one month and ask when their child will perform on stage!",0

While a large gathering of students mobilised from across the campus thronged Rohith Stupa, a concrete structure erected last year in his memory, the police and university security guards prevented the entry of more protesters on the campus by barricading all entrances to the university. The event was held at the main entrance of UoH amid tight security. The campus walls sported stencil sketches of Vemula. Slogans were raised, demanding punishment to the ‘culprits’ behind his suicide. Though the university authorities had denied permission for the event and had asked heads of all departments to conduct classes, student protesters from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, Jawaharlal Nehru University, and Osmania University managed to get into the varsity in advance. The classes on Tuesday were, however, not disturbed. The meet witnessed the forceful opening of university gates by student protesters who were joined by Jaan Mohammed Saifi, brother of Akhlaq who was killed in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly consuming beef, and Radhika Vemula, mother of Rohith Vemula. Family of the student who went missing from JNU, Najeeb, and victims of caste atrocities in Una, Gujarat, Piyush Sarvaiya, Ramesh Sarvaiya and Jeetu Sarvaiya, also attended the event to offer solidarity. Speaking at the meet, Radhika Vemula, who was accompanied by Raja Vemula, Rohith’s brother, asked students to never give up on their lives. “You should stand and fight and never end your lives. Your mothers can help you if you are in trouble. Confide in them,” she said alleging that the university authorities, including Vice-Chancellor Appa Rao, had not informed her of her son’s expulsion and other troubles. Ms. Vemula was removed by the police when she tried to enter the university later in the night. The meet called ‘Rohith Vemula Shahadath Din’ was inaugurated with students reading out the suicide note of Vemula. A section of faculty members of UoH also held a march on the campus in solidarity with the students. Leaders of the NSUI and the Students Islamic Organisation too participated in the event. A total of 16 protesters were detained by the police. Journalist detained, let off Kunal Shankar, Frontline magazine’s Telangana and Andhra Pradesh correspondent, was detained by the police for “trespass” in the University of Hyderabad. He was subsequently let off. A criminal case was registered against him by the Gachibowli police. Mr. Shankar was picked up and questioned for about an hour. A written complaint was made to the Gachibwoli police about him “trespassing” as outsiders’ entry had been restricted in UoH by the administration, said Prof. Vipin Srivastava, Pro Vice-Chancellor, UoH. ‘FIR not given’ A copy of the First Information Report (FIR) was not given to Mr. Shankar, he said. Asked about this, Madhapur Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Vishwa Prasad said it would be provided to the correspondent if he gave a written application to the police, since he was the accused. “A case was registered for trespass and violating the High Court order (barring outsider entry),” he added. “Nobody was taking responsibility for his [Mr. Shankar] entry,” he added.",1

The company has adopted a two-pronged approach of ensuring availability of its products and creating awareness about their relevance among the rural consumers. The contribution from the rural markets has gone up significantly and it has become a strong segment for the company, said Mondelez India Foods managing director Chandramouli Venkatesan. According to him, the structural enablers including the demographic dividend and high levels of disposal incomes are strong in rural segment and the company had created a separate hub to cater to the tier-III and IV markets. The company has appointed distributors and sub-stockists in its route to rural market and is activating the market through seeding exercise. “This is motivating the outlets to keep the products and see whether it will sell,” he told The Hindu . The sustained intervention in terms of creating the market and establishing coverage there had been working out well for the company. The Indian chocolate market, which was worth Rs.5,800 crore in 2014, is expected to reach Rs.12,200 crore by 2019 and Mondelez’ brand Cadbury has a 60 per cent share in it. Mr. Venkatesan said rural markets could be defined on the basis of their location, but the mind set of the people was very urban. “Contrary to popular perceptions, there is high level of disposable income in rural areas. Although the consumers in urban areas have higher income levels, they have to factor in issues like expenses on account of accommodation, travel and other factor. These factors are not present in rural areas, thus ensuring that there is more disposable income. The presence of large number of youth who prefer our products is another factor that drives the growth for us,” he said. Mondelez, in general, is bullish about the Indian market as there is low par capita consumption. Compared to around 10 kg consumption of chocolate per individual a year, the per capita consumption in India is less than 100 gm. “This shows the huge opportunity,” he said adding the company had therefore chalked out plans for investing in future and be ready to meet the demand as and when it rises.",0
389,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-editorialfeatures/training-takes-the-back-seat/article2740038.ece,features,editorialfeatures,Training takes the back seat,"Music is perhaps one of the most popular and widely practiced form of Fine Arts, transcending all kinds of cultural and linguistic barriers. Any form of fine art is difficult to master and almost impossible to perfect and music is no exception. Nature, it is learnt, has blessed almost two thirds of the human race with musical ability of some sort. Music has the power to bring out the deepest emotions. It can make one cry or bring a smile on one's face. In fact it is a magic medicine and many seek refuge in it when they are depressed or stressed. It is this intimacy that makes us listen to music or even hum or sing sometimes. This singing, or realistically speaking, expressing one's emotion musically, sometimes takes a serious turn. This desire to showcase musical expression in public domain then transforms into serious business - profession. And from here the musical journey begins... This desire to sing before an audience is innocent and beautiful and indeed it is perfectly alright to have such a genuine desire. But it is also important to understand that singing is an intricate art - a highly refined one at that, which requires systematic, prolonged and rigorous training, even to pass muster. This is an aspect we forget in our keen desire to reach the stage and perform. It is almost like preparing a formal meal for some specially invited guests, without even having learnt and experienced the basic aspects of cooking. This is why we have more noise and less music in the present. These days almost everyone sings and it does not stop here. Most of us want to become professional singers. Result, a complete disregard for and ignorance of the training part, as the need is never felt to go through one and the urge to get to the stage and perform overpowers the slight inclination to learn, if any. If at all, somewhere along the way one feels the need to gain some knowledge and training, it leads to hurried shortcuts and half-hearted attempts, best described as “Crash Courses.” It is observed that those who have attained the so-called partial success, suddenly feel that they lack the required knowledge and are not learned enough. But it is too late by then. It should be understood here that the stage or a performance brings in a different mindset within the artist. It is always recommended and rightly so, that while on stage, cover the mistakes and weaknesses if any, and get along. But the contrary is true when it comes to acquiring knowledge and during the learning process. While under training, the student is expected to make mistakes but then rectify those mistakes under the supervision and guidance of the teacher. Therefore it is good to make mistakes and then be corrected during the process of learning as this subsequently makes one flawless and educated. This is a different mindset. And these two mindsets discussed above, (those of a performer and that of a student) cannot c-exist. That is to say that one cannot be a student and a performer simultaneously in the true sense. What is implied here is that it is important to acquire the basic and intermediate levels of music education and only then as a senior student, attempt could then be made to perform on stage. From here on, slowly but steadily, stage should be the focus and hence the new journey towards the knowledge of experience with every performance. So basically, training in music could be simplified in these following steps: • Basic and Intermediate levels of training: formal music training • Advance level Training: along with small attempts to perform • Training through stage and experience: performances Parents, teachers and even the serious and experienced audience (rasikas) should emphasise on the importance and the need for a proper and formal music education and realise the importance of learning before putting the young musician on stage. It is said “art begins where science ends.” It is unfortunate that we have seized to regard music as a science and have moved on quickly to the art or creative elements. Hence there is no urgency and the need to learn this craft technically. It is being disrespectful towards one's art if attempts are made before learning the intricacies. Hence stage and performance can wait... learning and rigorous training come first. Needless to say, the the journey of learning and gaining knowledge is itself so beautiful and satisfying that the destination (success) matters no more, to the genuine traveller.

The facility was inaugurated by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on October 19, 2012. Surprisingly, it has no cooling chamber, which is a basic necessity, till date. At the time of its inauguration, it was said that modern facilities would be provided for marketing of flowers gathered from growers to enhance their profit. It was supposed to have a well equipped auction hall, receiving dock, flower grading area, modern cooling chamber for preservation of flowers, florist, flower distribution area as well as packing centre, where flowers would be packed in a scientific way so that they could be transported to far-off places. It was also proposed to develop digital mode of auctioning, providing connectivity with other major flower markets in the country. The flower market is aimed at promoting floriculture in the six districts of Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput, Kandhamal, Boudh, and Nayagarh. The facility was established at a cost of Rs.2.55 crore, out of which Rs.1.92 crore was provided under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikash Yojana. The Regulated Market Committee (RMC), Digapahandi, which had invested the remaining amount, is managing the market. When contacted, RMC secretary Pramod Kumar Panda said all efforts were being made to make the market functional at the earliest. He said the tender process for the cooling chamber would commence soon. “After establishment of the cooling chamber, the infrastructure required would be added,” he said. As per members of the Ganjam District Flower Growers’ Association, in 2013 the flower growers had incurred a loss despite bumper production as there was no storage and marketing facility at the market in the city. The growers started using the premises only to pack and send the produce to the flower mandi in Bhubaneswar. After the Phailin cyclone, flower production fell drastically in the district. It, however, picked up of late. The flower market is aimed at promoting floriculture in six districts Currently, it is used only to pack and send the produce to the mandi in Bhubaneswar Though set up in 2012, the facility, surprisingly, has no cooling chamber till date",0

While the sand lorry owners and drivers had called off their strike following an assurance by the district administration that it will facilitate transport of sand from neighbouring Hassan and Mandya districts, builders said their requirements are being met to some extent. “We are receiving sand. But, mostly it is delivered at night,” said Ravindra Bhat, member of the Builders’ Association of India, Mysuru chapter. One truckload of sand (about 200 cubic feet) is available for a price ranging from Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 15,000, while a large truckload (of around 400 cu ft) is available from Rs. 26,000 to Rs. 30,000. However, a few other contractors like Prasad continue to bemoan that scarcity continues in the city. Mysore City Local Lorry Owners’ Association B. Revanna said most of the sand offloaded in Mysuru has been sourced from Hassan, Mandya and Shimoga districts. Though Deputy Commissioner C. Shikha was not available for comment, senior officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) said they had intervened in the wake of the severe sand scarcity affecting Mysuru and spoke to the officials in neighbouring Hassan and Mandya to meet the requirements of sand in Mysuru. However, officials added that the city required about 400 to 500 truckloads of sand (200 cu ft) and a shortage still existed. Scarcity of sand had hit Mysuru ever since the lease period of 92 sand blocks expired three to four months ago, and the officials were unable to auction the 100 newly identified sand blocks along the Cauvery and its tributaries in view of the Supreme Court ban on ‘in-stream’ mining. When asked about the legality of sand extraction in neighbouring districts, PWD officials pointed out the leases of some sand blocks in the neighbouring districts had not expired yet. Pointing out that extraction of sand has become illegal in the wake of the Supreme Court order, Superintendent of Mysuru district Abhinav Khare said the police are continuing to crackdown on illegal extraction and transportation of sand in the district. “We are booking about five to six cases every day since in the last few days. During the last few days, we have seized and destroyed more than a dozen iron boats used in the extraction of sand in T Narspura taluk,” he said. M-sand being used Meanwhile, PWD officials said they were using either M sand (manufactured sand) or the sand seized by the police and released by the court to execute government projects. “As far as possible, we are also using M sand and encouraging its use among the other builders also,” an official said. Ever since the leases of the sand blocks in the district lapsed, a PWD official said, they have not been able to provide sand to individuals, who have taken up construction of houses in the city.",0

When the opposition Congress organised a padyatra in Salipur in Cuttack district as part of its Jana Jagaran Yatra on Saturday, the BJD roped in some dissident block level Congress workers from that area to show that its image had not been affected in any manner. A group of local Congress leaders from Salipur met the Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik at his residence here. The seven-km long padyatra by the Congress from Manoharpur to Salipur was attended by party supporters and farmers. The rally culminated in a public meeting where senior Congress leaders held the BJD government responsible for the spate of farmer suicides in the State since September. Many senior party leaders joined PCC president Prasad Harichandan in the padyatra and addressed the gathering criticising Chief Minister. Saturday’s was the third phase of the Jana Jagaran padyatra. The party had organised the first two phases of the padyatra at Angul and Dhenkanal, and Nuapada and Nabarangpur.

The incident occurred at 10.30 a.m. The pro-CPI(M) NGO Union activists alleged that the employees had been transferred based on a list submitted by the Congress-affiliated NGO Association district committee's treasurer C. Ranjith. Activists assemble The activists assembled in front of the office to prevent Mr. Ranjth from entering the building. In fact this was happening for the last two days making its impossible for him to attend office. However, on Wednesday, the rival NGO Association activists led by State unit secretary Abdul Razak made an attempt to let Mr. Ranjith enter the office. The gathering of two hostile groups resulted in a verbal duel initially and subsequently a fight ensued between them. Minor injuries The police had a difficult time to control the angry groups. Even then a few persons from both sides suffered minor injuries. Some of them have been admitted to the Government General Hospital at the Beach. Later, NGO Association State secretariat member V.C. Johnson clarified that usually transfers would take place when there was a change in government.

The next question sounded even more out of place. “How do you study?” The tenth class girls knew that no two persons study the same way and there is little doubt that what works for one person may not work for another. Grasping their predicament, the ‘teacher’ encouraged them to come up with their own individual ideas on how best one could study in a way that the lessons become easy to understand. “I study with concentration…with great interest…with a peaceful mind…answers came like in a rapid-fire round, bringing a wide grin on the ‘teacher’s face. The instructor was the resource person of The Hindu’s Newspaper in Education (NIE) programme at Krishnaveni Residential School at Poranki. The objective was to renew the interest of students in learning skills. Imparting tips on study skills to enable students enhance their academic performance, the resource person gave out some general techniques to produce good results. The blow-by-blow explanation of simple techniques helped the girls realise that there is no magic formula for success. Earlier, the issue of how, why, what, when and where to study seemed critical. But now they knew that a simple set of thumb rules, if followed in all earnest, could help them navigate through their academic journey with remarkable ease. All they had to do in a classroom was to remain relaxed and alert. When asked why does one study, girls came up with relatively satisfactory answers that ranged from: “For our sake…to gain knowledge…for a secure future…to achieve our goal and… to score good marks”. Emphasising that traits like concentration, hard work and confidence were key to cracking the code of success, the resource person asked them to follow simple rules for an enhanced learning experienced: Fix a place before you read; select a convenient place; make sure you have all the study material with you; prefer a proper study table; select areas free from distractions and make sure you have enough place to read.",0

Gupta noticed that the Bengali film industry was clearly divided into two extremes: art house and mainstream cinema. It’s a split that continues to exist. The 34-year-old Gupta says, “There are art house films which are struggling with box-office pressure, and then there are the loud mainstream movies, which are often remakes of Tamil and Telugu films.” He believes that the Bengali film industry, which has had a chequered past, boasting of legendary directors like Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Goutam Ghose, Aparna Sen and Rituparno Ghosh, is currently in a very confused state. “The only way Bengali films can bounce back is by bringing in the young audiences, that is people from 18 to 30 years.” How? He thinks “superior production values and sleek treatment” could do the trick. “The youth of Kolkata is into watching TV series and their eyes are attuned to watching [good production and] sleek stuff,” he says. “You can’t fool them by saying we didn’t have the budget so we made something artsy and not visually appealing, with low production value.” His latest film, Shaheb Bibi Golaam — which released in West Bengal last Friday, and will release in other cities across India on September 2 — was made keeping the young audience in mind. The thriller tells the story of three people, living starkly different lives, whose destinies intertwine because of one mistake. Gupta says the pressure to do well is being felt by Bengali filmmakers across the board. “The attempt to win [at] the box office has also affected veteran filmmakers like Aparna Sen, which is very disheartening,” he says. “She can’t make what she wants to make. Of the new-age filmmakers, some are trying hard. Filmmakers like Shiboprosad Mukherjee made Bela Seshe last year and Praktan this year, which have both been huge successes. At least he is getting the people in; which is very good.” All this comes at a time when the Indian audience is slowly getting more cine literate and receptive to films in all languages and from all nationalities. Gupta says regional movies with subtitles are gaining popularity as long they are made well. “We obviously can’t match the production values of a Hindi film, but if there is a good word of mouth from the Kolkata release, I’m sure a week later a lot of friends in other cities will watch it,” he says. There has been this confusion that a film titled Shaheb Bibi Golaam would be a Bengali remake of the 1962 Guru Dutt and Meena Kumari one. “Anybody who wants to see the movie must have definitely seen the trailer or the poster at least,” says Gupta. “That makes it very clear that is has nothing to do with the Hindi classic.” Gupta considered naming the film, Jimmy Jaya Javed and Trikaal before zeroing in on Shaheb Bibi Golaam . The film — starring Anjan Dutt, Swastika Mukherjee and Ritwick Chakraborty in the lead roles — is Gupta’s second feature film. He made X: Past Is Present in 2015, which was a collaborative feature film directed by a team of 10 other filmmakers. However, Gupta says it is completely different from his directorial debut, Paanch Adhyay , which also saw actress Dia Mirza make her first foray into Bengali cinema. “My first film was more like learning on the job. When you shoot you realise that you can’t do a lot that’s possible on paper,” says Gupta. For him, one of the biggest takeaways from his first film was getting the casting right. “ Paanch Adhyay was about good-looking actors. But this one is about good actors. Even if some of them are unknown names, they are great performers,” says Gupta. As for finding himself back at the helm of a feature film after four years, he says, “This one is a reboot for me as a filmmaker.” This one [Shaheb Bibi Golaam] is a reboot for me as a filmmaker",0

Led by A Sagayamadha, an office-bearer of the All India Farm Workers Association, the villagers, including a large number of women from the panchayat comprising six villages, staged the protest urging the district administration to immediately disconnect the illegal water connections and ensure uninterrupted water supply to them. Sagayamatha said the main pipeline passed through Sengudi panchayat and those who enjoyed influence with local officials, got illegal house connections, depriving water supply to the more than 5,000 people living in Varavani panchayat. As those in Sengudi panchayat and other places tapped the water and stored them in huge water tanks, others were deprived of their due share of drinking water, she said. “We have been facing the problem for the past two years,” she said. When the district administration made serious efforts to provide water supply to all hamlets in the district, officials at the panchayat level ‘colluded’ with the locals and indulged in the illegal acts. Even after the officials disconnected the illegal water connections, they got them reconnected after influencing the local officials, she alleged. A Chelladurai, Assistant Director, Panchayats, held talks with the representatives of the protesters and assured them that the issue would be resolved. In a brief chat with reporters, he said he had ordered the immediate disconnection of the illegal house connections. The problem arose when a few people illegally drew excess water from the main pipeline leading to drop in pressure and fall in water supply to other villages.

While branded software is already covered by VAT, the Commercial Taxes Department is currently examining issues relating to customised software, works contract, consultancy services and exports in the light of the Supreme Court’s judgement laying down certain criteria on what constitutes sale of software and thereby attracts tax. According to official sources, the Government will interact with the Information Technology (IT) industry before taking a final decision in about a month’s time. The department has formed special teams to analyse different kinds of agreements of IT companies and see whether they come under pure services or could be categorised as sale. It is also studying the tax pattern in Karnataka. “It is not a straightforward thing and There are many grey areas,” the sources said. Increased competition Meanwhile, the Hyderabad Software Exporters Association (HYSEA) has opposed the move of the Government to levy VAT saying the timing was wrong. HYSEA’s executive director K. Hari Kumar said the tax holiday should continue for some more years as the Indian industry was facing increased competition from China and the cost of operations was going up. Already Minimal Alternate Tax (MAT), service tax and tax on employees’ stock options were being collected. He said the Government should not hasten with the proposal as it might lead to negative growth. “Why should the Government take an initiative to lose out the advantage that Hyderabad enjoys? It will affect the overall growth of exports which is projected to be around 25 per cent this year.” He said that HYSEA would bring small and medium enterprises and the Commerical Taxes Department on to a common platform to discuss the issue as they (SMEs) would be the most affected. Stronger rupee FICCI’s coordinator and head of Andhra Pradesh State Council, Rajendra Kumar also echoed similar views saying that imposing VAT at this juncture was not the right thing.

Satchidanandan has cautioned against the increasing influence of right-wing fascism that led to shrinking democratic space in the country. He was speaking at a lecture on ‘Indian democracy at a crossroads’ organised on Monday in connection with the ongoing golden jubilee celebrations of the State Institute of Languages. Dr. Satchidanandan said that the country was in the midst of an alarming period that posed a far greater challenge than the Emergency of the 1970s. “While the Emergency had been brought about by muffling democratic powers using the Constitution, the ‘Emergency’ we witness today is marked by efforts to silence the Constitution using the power gained through democracy. With the situation being facilitated by the civil society and organisations through politics, we are staring at a bleak and uncertain future,” he said. According to him, efforts were being made by those endangered by democratic values to govern democratic institutions. Such sections yearned to dilute environmental laws, labour norms, and feared the citizens’ right to question decisions, freedom of expression and a free press. The society has been witnessing efforts made to narrow down the confines of politics. “While the Constitution aimed for the establishment of the country as a sovereign, secular, socialist and democratic republic, there is apprehension among many independent thinkers that we were headed in the opposite direction. We could describe the country as a servile, theocratic, pro-corporate, proto-fascist nation State under the existing circumstances,” he said. He was critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio broadcast ‘Mann ki Baat’, which he claimed was rhetoric. He cautioned against attempts to portray vested interests as the general will of the public. The poet formally released a book ‘Hindutva Fascism: History and Ideology,’ authored by J.

Curfew continued in the town without any relaxation. The district town of Tonk, which also witnessed communal tension during the Holi celebration on Saturday, was peaceful. The fort town of Chittaurgarh, 322 km from here, was rocked by communal violence when mobs attacked shops, kiosks and cabins near Qazi Shah’s dargarh and set them on fire.

But he had quite a bad experience the other day. He had gone to one of the restaurants in Pandara Road Market and asked for his favourite — a plate of brain curry. The curry arrived, and he took a mouthful and started feeling queasy. The restaurant very properly didn’t charge him for the dish, but Murali was shattered. Imagine the plight he was in — magaz masala in front of him, and the poor guy couldn’t eat it. He told me this story, and it upset me so much that I felt I had to eat some brain curry to get back into my usual cheerful frame. So I looked around in my neighbourhood and zeroed in on a new eatery. I liked its name — Yaaran Di Hatti — and was especially moved when I saw a little message on their takeaway menu card, ‘Speciality Magaz’. Yaaran Di Hatti is in Mayur Vihar Phase 2, behind Virmani Hospital, and rather conveniently between two chemist shops. I went there and had a look, and was impressed by the fact that the place was very clean, with an open and spruced up kitchen. There are a few high tables for people who want to have a quick meal there. And, of course, it’s a takeaway too, and does deliveries in the area. The address is shop no. 6, G.S. Arcade, Local Shopping Centre, Pocket B, Mayur Vihar - Phase 2. The place is open for both lunch and dinner, but is shut on Tuesdays. I looked at the menu card and was happy to see that it offered three kinds of brain dishes — Amritsari magaz masala, magaz chatkara and handi magaz. I asked for a plate of Amritsari magaz masala (Rs.200 for full, Rs.120 for half), dal makhni (Rs.100), a plate of chicken biryani with gravy (Rs.180), and a butter naan and lachchha paratha (both Rs.20). Then, the day after, I ordered an Afghani chicken (Rs.160 for half) and butter chicken (Rs.220 for half). I was yearning for some brain curry, and Yaaran’s fare was just what I was looking for. The brain was buttery and soft, and hadn’t been overwhelmed with masalas or chillies. (Some people do that, killing its subtle taste.) It went very well with the parantha, which was very nice indeed. (The naan had become a bit rubbery, as it happens when it goes cold). The dal was excellent — creamy and rich — and the biryani had a nice minty flavour. The following day’s order wasn’t bad either. The chicken pieces in the butter chicken were nicely succulent, though the gravy was a bit too sweet. The Afghan chicken was delicious; the chicken was soft and juicy, mildly spiced and perfectly cooked. So Yaaran Di Hatti did not disappoint. My only worry is that restaurants that serve good food don’t seem to thrive in our locality. The Tunday kabab eatery that opened a few months ago has now downed its shutters. But YDH must go on — and for that, brain curry lovers must stand up to be counted. Yaaran Di Hatti did not disappoint. My only worry is that restaurants that serve good food don’t seem to thrive in our locality.",0

The two legends formed a unique partnership and displayed some amazing strokes on the tabla and slit drums at an event recently in Mumbai. Both pushed the boundaries in their own way. The Ustad is the king of collaboration, who never fails to excite and entertain. A bold technician and whimsical inventor, his ensembles with illustrious and young musicians from across the globe have set the tone for the future. His crossover shows may not always be embraced by classical aficionados, but they have definitely been influential. They have opened up the classical repertoire to newer interpretations. His two-hour performance in Chennai in early January with violinist Kumaresh and vainika Jayanthi Kumaresh was a case in point. The standing ovation continued till the Ustad, in a lighter vein, pointed towards the exit door. The audience did leave the hall only to gather outside the green room waiting for the maestro to step out. The Ustad is one of those rare non-film musicians, whom people will trudge far to meet, not just for his musical worth but because of his flamboyance off stage. The way rhythm emerges intuitively from the blur of his fingers, the answers come through even before the question is asked at a quick post-concert interview. Co-creator, mentor, genre explorer, progressive classicist…is it important to be much more than an artist? “I have never projected myself as anything more than an artist. It’s just that I do not like to be alone on stage. I keep forming new friendships on the concert platform, ,” he laughs. Besides the power-packed beats, his uncanny sense of humour enlivens his concerts. Talking about the buzz over the need to reinvent the classical idiom, the Ustad says, “Evolution is a natural process and art is no exception. These are exciting times, when there is greater interest to open the doors of possibilities and windows of the mind.” The Ustad raised the musical bar by making rhythm more expressive. “Artists should always strive to take their learning to the next level. It shapes their individuality. Bhimsen Joshi did not sing like Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. Balamuralikrishna sir had his own style, so did Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. All these greats never worried about expressing themselves.” The Ustad, who has always been accommodative of young talents, feels that the music scene is in an incredibly fertile form. “I want to tell the youngsters what Pt. Ravi Shankar said to an up–and–coming musician, after he performed at the maestro’s house to seek his blessings, ‘Lage raho Munna bhai’.” The Ustad, who has always been accommodative of young talents, feels that the music scene is in an incredibly fertile form.",0

In all, 170 permissions for murtikar s have not been granted due to lack of no-objection certificates (NOC). Another reason for 31 applications not being accepted in Malad is non-payment of a fee of Rs. 600 to Rs. 700 by applicants. Anand Waghralkar, Deputy Municipal Commissioner, BMC said 1,153 applications for Ganeshotsav mandap s have been put on hold. “Once the permissions from police and traffic departments are submitted, BMC will grant permissions. We rejected 161 applications for murtikar s and 74 for mandap s as they did not fit into the policy we have framed. The terms and conditions laid down for arranging murtikar s for Ganesh mandap s were not met.” The highest number of rejected applications for mandap s were from G-North ward comprising Dadar at 25, followed closely by Parel from where 22 applications were rejected. In Lower Parel, BMC is yet to accept any applications, and 86 were pending with the civic body on Friday. Last month, the Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti, the coordination committee of Ganesh mandals, had demanded an online system. The BMC had promised to take the application process online, but said it is still working on the software. Under the new policy, civic officials will grant permissions only to those applicants who have obtained NOCs from the city and traffic police departments. While awaiting permissions, many mandals have gone ahead and constructed pandals. According to BMC officers, close to 11,000 idols from various mandals are immersed in the city, but only 15% of them have permission to set up pandals.

THIS IS the text of an appeal issued by nine leading nuclear scientists, all former heads of nuclear-related organisations, on the eve of Independence Day: While the nation and Parliament discuss the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal from various angles, we feel it is our responsibility to place before the nation our well-considered views on the impact of this deal on the future of Indian nuclear science and technology, and its effects on the energy security of the nation. We have all worked in the field of atomic energy from the very early years after India's independence. From very small beginnings, we have now reached a stage where we are in possession of all the technologies needed for the production of electricity from indigenous nuclear minerals, and have successfully applied these technologies in diverse sectors from health, agriculture and industry to national and energy security. All this has been possible with the support of the people represented in the government through Parliament, and the outstanding statesmen who have guided and supported our plans. We therefore feel it is our obligation to make public our perceptions for the effective and continued nurturing and utilisation of this technology in the country. Science is universal. Knowledge can be created in any part of the world, and technology comes with experimentation and the willingness to take risks. We have followed all these paths to reach the present stage of development. We are amongst the most advanced countries in the technology of fast-breeder reactors, which is crucial to the future of our energy security. Along the way we have derived benefits from international collaboration. At the same time, we have also shared some of our abilities in this field with the world. Indian scientists have been ambassadors, with knowledge and creativity as their tools. It is of prime importance to uphold these cherished traditions. It is significant that the most advanced country in nuclear science and technology has come forward to accept us into the international nuclear community, by the historic document signed by our Prime Minister with President Bush on 18th July, 2005. The basic principles for cooperation were well laid out in this bilateral understanding and the Prime Minister has apprised our Parliament of this. No doubt it needs the concurrence of the other nations comprising the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Based on this agreement, the U.S. lawmakers and the administration are in the process of re-framing their laws, which could change the nature of relations between the two countries. This is a most welcome initiative of the UPA government, and is a continuation of the process essentially begun during the previous NDA government. Thus, there is no question of any political partisanship on this matter. However, the lawmakers of the U.S. Congress have modified, both in letter and spirit, the implementation of such an agreement. At this juncture, among other aspects, it is essential that we insist on the following four central themes: 1. India should continue to be able to hold on to her nuclear option as a strategic requirement in the real world that we live in, and in the ever-changing complexity of the international political system. This means that we cannot accede to any restraint in perpetuity on our freedom of action. We have not done this for the last forty years after the Non-Proliferation Treaty came into being, and there is no reason why we should succumb to this now. Universal nuclear disarmament must be our ultimate aim, and until we see the light at the end of the tunnel on this important issue, we cannot accept any agreement in perpetuity.2. After 1974, when the major powers discontinued cooperation with us, we have built up our capability in many sensitive technological areas, which need not and should not now be subjected to external control. Safeguards are understandable where external assistance for nuclear materials or technologies are involved. We have agreed to this before, and we can continue to agree to this in the future too, but strictly restricted to those facilities and materials imported from external sources.3. We find that the Indo-U.S. deal, in the form approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, infringes on our independence for carrying out indigenous research and development (R&D) in nuclear science and technology. Our R&D should not be hampered by external supervision or control, or by the need to satisfy any international body. Research and technology development are the sovereign rights of any nation. This is especially true when they concern strategic national defence and energy self-sufficiency. 4. While the sequence of actions to implement the cooperation could be left for discussion between the two governments, the basic principles on which such actions will rest is the right of Parliament and the people to decide. The Prime Minister has already taken up with President Bush the issue of the new clauses recommended by the U.S. House of Representatives. If the U.S. Congress, in its wisdom, passes the bill in its present form, the `product' will become unacceptable to India, and, diplomatically, it will be very difficult to change it later. Hence it is important for our Parliament to work out, and insist on, the ground rules for the nuclear deal, at this stage itself. We therefore request you, the Parliamentarians, to discuss this deal and arrive at a unanimous decision, recognising the fundamental facts of India's indigenous nuclear science and technology achievements to date, the efforts made to overcome the unfair restrictions placed on us and the imaginative policies and planning enunciated and followed in the years after Independence. The nation, at this critical juncture, depends on its representatives in Parliament to ensure that decisions taken today do not inhibit our future ability to develop and pursue nuclear technologies for the benefit of the nation.

With the objective of empowering the economically weaker women by augmenting their revenue through murrel culture, the CARE, has proposed to conduct a comprehensive 3-day training programme in July. As the Centre’s proposal received financial assistance from Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, an orientation progamme in this regard was organised on Wednesday. Addressing the meet, CARE director and CISR Emeritus Scientist M. A. Haniffa said 180 beneficiaries would be selected from the three districts and offered free training for seed production, larval rearing and culture of murrel fish. Training would also be offered for fillet preparation, ready to eat and ready to cook products from murrel fish. In a minimum area of 1cent, 50 to 75 table-size murrels (each weighing about 750 gm) can be cultured to earn from Rs. 15,000 to 20,000 per year. Minimum water availability is enough and the beneficiaries need not drain the water frequently, since murrels are air breathers. According to availability of more land and water resources one can increase the number of murrels. The stakeholders can supply kitchen wastes in semi moist form to feed the murrel fingerlings and within 10 months they can harvest table-size murrels each weighing about 750 gm to 1 Kg, Dr. Haniffa said.

The outcome – security arrangements were beefed up and visible policing has come to be. Railway stations have evidently came under elaborate security cover of the State’s Government Railway Police (GRP) and the Railway Protection Force (RPF). Bag scanners, door frame metal detectors and inspection on trains, platforms, and freight sections, mainly by bomb squads have been intensified. A few commonly used pathways and gaps for easy entry into Chennai Central and Egmore Railway stations are being guarded. On Sunday, the discovery of what looked like a country-made explosive detected with a handwritten threat letter on the tracks under the Uzhavan Express at Chennai Egmore only underlined the gravity of the situation. Other government establishments, places of worship, cinema halls, hotels and lodges and spots where people gather in large numbers have come under the scanner. City police have now constituted teams to carry out regular inspection at malls following the blasts. The top brass of the State intelligence unit met their city police counterparts recently and topics related to security lacunae were apparently one of the key subjects discussed. Regular exchange of information between the two agencies in future was also agreed upon. Hopefully, the alertness and anti-sabotage measures put in place by the enforcement agencies to ensure security in Chennai will continue uninterrupted. But it is upto every citizen in the city to remain extra vigilant and be aware of the possible threats around. Soon after the heat and dust of the twin blasts settled, city policemen worked overtime to step up security arrangements all over the city and schools were among the most important establishments under the scanner. Senior police officials interacted with school heads. Policemen issued a list of instructions to school managements, the most important among them being measures to monitor the movement of children and those accompanying them. The other major recommendation was for school authorities to keep a watch on the crew of vehicles which pick up and drop children. “Installation of surveillance cameras has become mandatory to keep a track of the movement of people around school premises. CCTV footage helped in rescuing a boy kidnapped last year by a person who pretended to his van driver,” said a police inspector in South Chennai, in whose jurisdiction are more than a dozen top-listed schools. School managements can no longer shun the responsibility of students’ safety, even outside their premises. They have to make sure that only parents, close relatives or trusted domestic helps drop children. They also have to ensure that drivers and attendants of vehicles have a valid address. However, the headmistress of a CBSE school in the suburbs said she had not received any communication on this meeting. She however said private schools were doing everything within their resources to ensure that students’ safety remained a priority. (Reporting by Petlee Peter and K. Manikandan)",1

The party maintained that government should shoulder the responsibility for the violent incidents related with the agitation. Addressing a press conference TRS leader B. Goverdhan Reddy and others said the march was a success despite the hurdles created by the government. Protagonists reached Hyderabad by evading arrests, he added. Meanwhile, pro-Telangana activists under the banner of Telangana Joint Action Committee formed a human chain and took the oath. The agitators demanded a Bill in Parliament to carve out Telangana State. Not many from Adilabad district managed to reach the State capital due to the preventive arrests made by the police during the last three days. In all, about 150 activists proceeding towards Hyderabad were detained by police on Thursday morning. Attempts Karimnagar Staff Reporter adds: The district police foiled the attempts made by the TRS and pro-Telangana activists to proceed and participate in ‘Million March' in Hyderabad on Thursday with their arrests on various routes proceeding to the capital. TRS district leaders S. Ravinder Singh and Katla Satish arranged vehicles for the party rank and file to proceed to Hyderabad. However, as soon as the vehicles crossed Alugunur cross roads on the outskirts of Karimnagar town, the police stopped the vehicles and detained the activists and shifted them to the police station. Irked over the arrests, the protestors staged dharna. The TRS students' wing activists staged dharna in front of Karimnagar One Town police flaying the arrests of their activists and obstructing them from proceeding to Hyderabad. Reports reaching here said that the police detained several activists proceeding to Hyderabad from parts of the district such as Sircilla, Vemulawada, Metpally, Jagtial, Ramagundam, Huzurabad, Husnabad and other mandals. Orders Nizamabad Staff Reporter adds: Despite prohibitory orders imposed on the movement of Telangana protagonists many of them from the district managed to make it to the twin cities take part in the ‘Million March' held on Thursday. According to reports around 4,000-5,000 Telangana activists from the district participated in the march hoodwinking the police. The police rounded up around 300 leaders and protagonists and registered 43 cases against them. Preventive arrests were made a couple of days before the ‘D-Day'. Since two passenger trains were cancelled, engaging of private vehicles were restricted and each vehicle was thoroughly checked at all check-posts along the National Highway-7 many activists decided to give the march a miss. People remained glued to the television boxes watching the incidents that unfolded during the march.

Venkateswar Murthy, co-convener Amarender Reddy, CPI district secretary Adi Reddy. Several pro-Telangana activists were arrested in Choutuppal, Bhongir and Miryalguda, where the Telugu Desam Party extended support to the agitation. Durga Prasad, TDP district general secretary, was along those arrested. The agitators staged ‘rasto roko' demonstrations at Veligonda, Nakrekal, Choutuppal and Bhongir towns in the district.

However, the government has provided the much-needed stability at the Centre. Its handling of foreign affairs is particularly noteworthy. The Right to Information Act, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, and the civilian nuclear deal with the U.S. are some of its achievements. D.B.N. Murthy, Bangalore The three years of UPA rule have seen some unprecedented social justice measures that seek to involve every section in the nation's development. Though the measures are yet to be implemented in full, a sincere attempt is being made to implement them. Surely the nation cannot become a developed one when large sections remain out of the national mainstream. Let India shine for everyone. Sachin Kurmi, Ghaziabad The government is doing very well on all fronts, particularly agriculture which the NDA government had totally neglected. It will take some more time for all the initiatives to bear fruit. As for inflation, some inflation is desirable as it is a consequence of robust economic growth. Sanjay Kuruba, Bangalore While the UPA government can be credited with some achievements, its shortcomings outweigh them. The biggest drawback is a Prime Minister who is unable to assert himself. On the economic front, all and sundry items are taxed in the name of service tax and the additional burden is passed on to the common man. Economic growth is lopsided with the stress on urban uplift. Even the retail sector is being taken over by multinationals. In spite of one of the biggest economic brains heading the government, the country is cracking under rising prices. K.R.A. Narasiah, Chennai The Prime Minister is facing an uphill task of implementing the common minimum programme in a coalition set-up, thanks to the threats from allies and supporting parties. Inflation has been galloping by leaps and bounds affecting the common man. Unemployment is on the increase. In the name of industrialisation, acres and acres of cultivable lands across the country have been reduced to nothing. The UPA government is of the rich, for the rich, and by the rich. L.R. Moorthy, Thane The UPA came to power with a promise to respond to the needs of the aam admi. Except for the introduction of NREGP and withdrawal of POTA, the government has nothing much to show as achievements. At the end of the day, the aam admi is still searching for the elusive promises made three years ago. Mere slogans cannot sustain a democracy. The NDA lost power for reasons the present government is aware of. It is time it pulled its socks up. N. Divakar, Mysore",0

Padma Priya Eight youths from the weaver community, employed in odd jobs, find a viable vocation after training in weaving and dyeing HYDERABAD: It was a skill that literally ran in their blood. But it was an opportunity that was missing for a good 20 years. For these eight rural youth from Kolluru village in Adilabad District, weaving might not have been a natural livelihood choice, but it surely paved a way out of their poverty. For D. Bhaskar, A. Suresh, D. Damodar, D. Mahesh, D. Chandrashekar, D. Sampath. V. Nagesh and R. Srinivas, the wheel of fortune turned in their favour when they were identified by Dastkar Andhra (DA), a city-based NGO. Aged between 20 and 24, the eight hailing from the weaver community were living in abject poverty. Many had dropped out of school and had been employed in odd jobs. Motivation Their condition was brought to the notice of DA in 2006 when an older group of weavers in nearby Chennur informed them. A year’s training in weaving and dyeing, and the youth were all set to weave their own fortunes. “They were quick in grasping what was taught,” says V. Dharmender, in-charge, DA Production & Design, DA. Apart from appointing a master weaver to train them, DA also paid them a monthly stipend of Rs.1,000. “What motivated us to take up weaving was the fact that we didn’t have to work under anybody,” says D. Chandrasekhar. Even after graduation, D. Sampath, a former teacher at a government school, finds weaving a sustainable livelihood optionHere to participate in a DA design workshop, they swear by their new found profession. Now named ‘Individual Weavers Co-operative Society’ as a group, they now earn anything between Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 9,000 individually per month. “They are very confident now and have even paid back their bank loans,” says Ravinder of DA. He said they were identifying similar youngsters from backward regions of Andhra Pradesh. “As long as they are interested in learning weaving, DA is ready to assist them,” he says.",0

436,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/S.-Africa-doesnt-choke-this-time/article14946073.ece,sports,None,S. Africa doesn't choke this time,"On a day of fortune swings, Sachin Tendulkar conjured up a century and Dale Steyn sent down an inspired spell. And a lesser name, Robin Peterson, emerged the hero in an explosive climax. Pursuing 297, South Africa required 13 runs from the final over bowled by left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra. South Africa did not choke on this occasion. Peterson edged a swipe to the boundary, dismissed the paceman beyond the mid-wicket ropes, collected a brace and then forced the bowler through covers to nail a sensational three-wicket win for his side in the Group B World Cup match at the Vidarbha Cricket Association ground here on Saturday. Zaheer Khan had sent down an exceptional 49th over of control — he conceded only four runs. Peterson and Francois du Plessis, who displayed a calm head under pressure, had the last laugh. Turning point The turning point of the match arrived much earlier when India, mismanaging its batting Power Play, collapsed from 267 for one to 296 all out in a span of 54 deliveries. Man-of-the-Match Steyn, mixing his pace and length and unleashing telling yorkers, picked up five wickets. Then, A.B. de Villiers came up with a blinder under pressure in the chase. Light on his feet, he was able to convert the length. South Africa came back from the brink. The batting Power Play, from the 37th to the 41st overs, yielded South Africa a whopping 52 runs for the loss of a wicket. The side was back in the hunt. The Indian bowling wilted under pressure conceding 99 runs in the last 11 overs. And the fielding, save on a couple of exceptions, was below international standards. Yet, India called the shots at the start. With the surface becoming a tad slow, momentum eluded South African openers Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla. The left-handed Smith never appeared comfortable before falling to his nemesis Zaheer Khan as the opener miscued a drive to mid-off. Asking rate climbs As the ball got softer, finding boundaries became harder. Not quite middling the ball, Amla (61) and Kallis (69) were largely restricted to singles. As the partnership developed, the asking rate climbed. Yet, the two senior batsmen had built a platform. Amla, grassed by Yuvraj Singh at mid-wicket off Harbhajan on 57, soon succumbed to the off-spinner on the cut to a delivery that bounced a shade more; Dhoni held a smart catch. And the fighting Kallis was caught short of the crease after Harbhajan released a throw to Dhoni from widish fine-leg. The host's batting folded after the openers Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag (73) had blitzed 142 runs in only 17.4 overs. Then Tendulkar and a fluent Gautam Gambhir (69) carried the score to 267 before Tendulkar fell. The slide began with the batting Power Play taken from the 39th over — the home side lost four wickets for 30 runs in these five overs. The Indian batsmen lost their way tactically. And Steyn compounded their problems. Blistering spells of 2-0-7-2 and 1.4-0-2-3 of precision and swing by Steyn at the ‘death' cut short the Indian innings. Smith was spot on when he brought back Steyn and Morkel for the batting Power Play overs. Morkel achieved the breakthrough when Tendulkar sliced one to point. Then Steyn consumed Gambhir with a slower one and had Yusuf Pathan — promoted in the order — well caught by Smith at cover. The slide had begun and Kallis with his back-of-a-length variety and persistent left-arm spinner Peterson contributed to the South African cause as well. Earlier, Tendulkar delighted with his 99th international hundred; it was his 48th century in ODIs and sixth in the World Cup. His body and mind in harmony, Tendulkar bisected the field with flowing front-footed cover-drives. The maestro's broad blade came into view as Morkel was straight driven with grace and timing. When Steyn banged one in short, Tendulkar swiftly pulled him beyond the mid-wicket fence. Tendulkar glided down the track to the spinners, drove, flicked and lofted with the touch and assurance of a wizard. And he used the depth of the crease for strokes behind square on either side. Sehwag and Tendulkar stepped on the gas after Dhoni won the toss. India raced to 87 off the first 10 Power Play overs. Sehwag, reprieved by 'keeper van Wyk off Morkel on four, launched into the pacemen. A combination of the ability to pick the length early and exceptional bat speed enabled Sehwag to pierce the field. He also punished the pacemen with short-arm jabs on either side of the wicket. Sehwag departed after attempting to create room to force leg-spinner du Plessis and playing on. Under pressure to produce a sizable innings, the left-handed Gambhir batted with composure and timing. He picked his ones and twos initially and then expanded his range of shots, a fleet-footed cover-drive off off-spinner Johan Botha catching the eye. India: V. Sehwag b du Plessis 73 ( 66b, 12x4), S.

Chandrababu Naidu has said. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, Mr Naidu said that he had fasted for eight days and visited every district in the State three or four times. Every time the problem of the farmers was highlighted by the Telugu Desam Party, the government announced some measures, but did nothing to rectify the problem, he said. Mr. Naidu said that he had written umpteen letters to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, and Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy but to no avail. The UPA Government at the Centre was in power with the support of Congress MPs from Andhra Pradesh, but they were not even in a position to impress upon the Central government to relax the norms for purchase of paddy affected by unseasonal rains. “We have called the MPs names to provoke them to do something for the farmers of Andhra Pradesh. None of them did anything to prove us wrong,” Mr. Naidu said. Saying the 90 per cent of the farmers were in debt, Mr. Naidu said the Central government was eager to permit export of Basmati rice grown in Punjab. But it would not permit export of the superior BPT rice grown in Andhra Pradesh, he added. Farmers were resorting to distress sale of paddy at Rs. 500 and Rs. 600 a quintal because the FCI was not buying from them. The farmers were stuck with huge stocks of foodgrains, but the godowns of the State were full with wheat cultivated in North India, he said.",0

Terming the order as one that would prove to be a death knell for taxi-cab firms that operate multi and sports-utility vehicles, executive committee member of Kerala Travel Operators Association Dileep Kumar K.S. said they were already hit by an influx of web-based taxi services and hike in expenses on insurance, maintenance and wages. “A new base-model SUV like Innova would cost over Rs.12 lakh. They can operate for around 15 years without violating pollution norms if they are driven carefully and if owners adhere to the service and maintenance schedule.” ‘Well-intended order’ He hastened to add that the NGT order was well intended, considering steep increase in respiratory ailments among city residents. “We should not wait till matters get out of hand and let pollution caused by automobiles reach the level in metropolitan cities,” Mr. Kumar, who has been operating a fleet of taxis since 1984 said. Private bus operators have been on the warpath during the past couple of years demanding extension of legal operable life for city buses from 15 to 20 years and that for limited stop buses from 10 to 15 years. They reiterated their demand in the backdrop of Monday’s order, citing annual fitness test as a method to ensure upkeep of buses in ‘good condition’. “Approximately 70 per cent, that is 9,000 of 16,000 private buses that operate in Kerala, are over 10 years old. Prohibiting them in the six major cities would seriously make a dent into public transport, while also affecting thousands of bus owners and workers since rolling out a brand new bus costs up to Rs.25 lakh,” said general secretary of All Kerala Bus Operators’ Organisation T.

Sources told The Hindu that an identification document, issued by the Election Commission, belonging to Mohammad Ashraf Paddar, a schoolteacher from Jammu and Kashmir, detained on suspicion of having participated in the attack, was found outside a military facility in Bangalore on September 5. Concerned at a possible terrorist strike on their premises, the Army authorities promptly forwarded the card to the Police Commissioner, asking for verification of his antecedents. The Bangalore police officials, however, forwarded this request to the Jammu and Kashmir police, through the Intelligence Bureau, only on December 29. Jammu and Kashmir police officials, contacted by The Hindu , said their Bangalore counterparts' failure to follow the common-sense procedure - of phoning Srinagar for verification of the document - highlighted serious problems in the functioning of the force. ""We get calls several times a week from our colleagues in other States,"" a senior official said, ""and teams often visit us for follow-up investigation. The Bangalore police could have just picked up the phone or put someone on a flight."" The Jammu and Kashmir police authorities say they are still unsure whether Paddar visited Bangalore in the weeks before the attack or whether the card was used by another individual with or without his consent. Paddar reported the loss of his card, issued just before the 2002 Assembly elections, soon after he obtained it. In 2003, he applied for and received a fresh card from the Election Commission. With no record of his involvement in terrorism, Paddar is an unlikely suspect. The Jammu and Kashmir police say his brother was murdered by terrorists some years ago. Investigators say Paddar has given a number of contradictory statements that have fuelled suspicion of his possible role in the Bangalore attack. For example, Paddar first said he had not travelled outside the State in years but then admitted to visiting Shimla in Himachal Pradesh some months ago. Whether or not Paddar was involved in the attack, sources close to the investigation seem increasingly convinced that the assault rifles and grenades used in the Bangalore strike were transported from Jammu and Kashmir. Local Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives are thought to have made arrangements to transport and harbour an assault unit from Jammu and Kashmir but did not participate in the attack. News that Paddar's card was found outside a military facility means it may also be considered a target. The Lashkar cells have often used similar tactics. Several separate Lashkar units, for example, carried out the recent serial bombings in New Delhi, communicating only through Tariq Ahmad Dar, the organisation's alleged principal organiser in Srinagar. For the 2002 attack on the Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, separate cells were charged with transporting fidayeen to the city, moving their weapons and transporting them to the site of assault.",1

Seven of the Maoists slain in the fierce gun battle belonged to the Khammam-Karimnagar-Warangal (KKW) divisional committee, which was entrusted with the onerous job of making inroads into the North Telangana districts. The three districts are extremely important as they share borders with southern Chhattisgarh, where the revolutionary movement is in a strategic offensive stage. For the Maoist think-tank, the only hope of reviving the extremist movement in Andhra Pradesh was through incursions in Karimnagar, Khammam, and Warangal bordering Chhattisgarh or through the agency areas of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam, which share borders with Orissa, where the Maoist movement is significantly strong. Though Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts too share borders with Orissa, the Maoists not very active in the border areas of these two districts. Adilabad, is another district which shares borders with Gadchiroli side of Maharashtra. The Maoist party pinned its hopes on the KKW division committee for implementing its grand plan to revive the revolutionary movement in Telangana. Strategically, the KKW committee and the squads under its command confined themselves to areas in Chhattisgarh borders because of the relative safety they enjoyed, but were moving into Khammam, Karimnagar and Warangal forest areas. The only other possibility of rebuilding the Naxalite movement in Andhra Pradesh was ordering the underground cadres in Orissa to move into the agency areas in East Godavari and Visakhapatnam. But the series of setbacks the Naxalite movement suffered in Orissa recently, made the Maoist leaders to depend mainly on the KKW committee, which has been eliminated now in Tuesday’s encounter. “With the KKW committee being eliminated now, it will take at least five years for the Maoists to build the cadre again,” a senior police officer analysed. Six hail from Warangal Of the nine bodies of Maoists recovered in the Sukma encounter, seven were identified. Of these, six hailed from Warangal and the seventh from Karimnagar district. The KKW division committee was led by Marri Ravi alias Sudhakar, who hailed from Seetharampur village in Ghanpur mandal of Warangal district. The others were: Guguloth Laxmi alias Pushpa, Rampally village in Bhupalpalli mandal; Etti Narsakka alias Sabitha of Gogupalli village; Jangoan Raju alias Durgam Raju, Buttaigudem; Seetha alias Navatha of Puredipallly (all in Eturunagarn mandal); Ajay alias Bheema, Kousettivai village in Tadvai mandal (all in Warangal district); and Arelli Venkati of Khanapur village in Manthani mandal of Karimangar.

There will be more litigation in future when some of the long-suffering people are made aware of their rights, Chief Justice of Madras High Court Ajit Prakash Shah said on Sunday. Inaugurating a special court to deal with forest offence cases here, he said the cases pending in courts should be cleared at the earliest. This could not be possible without the full co-operation of members of the Bar and the presiding judges. Human hope had its limit, and waiting endlessly was not possible in the modern society. The consumer of justice wanted an unpolluted, expeditious and inexpensive justice. In its absence, the affected person might be tempted to take the law into his hands. So, the judiciary should not allow the people to take recourse to extra-judicial methods to get their grievances redressed. The lack of a speedy dispute resolution mechanism had impacted the level of lawlessness. He said those involved in litigation should not take as a sign of failure of the system but as a sign of faith in the administration of justice. The judiciary could not escape criticism for the number of cases pending, but the executive was also partly responsible. The judge of High Court, R. Banumathi, said the system needed to be re-rationalised and effectively managed to deliver speedy justice. The Government had sanctioned 84 courts during 2007-08. The profession of law was noble and divine calling. It required not only learning but also the sense of social responsibility. An advocate should stand for justice. Collector (in charge) B. Jothi Nirmala said steps would be taken to ensure Kanyakumari was free from pollution, as sought by the Chief Justice after he saw polythene bags littered in the railway station.

It said these programmes can be held after taking prior permission from the authorities.

My travel companions look like they have stumbled off the Paris Fashion Week ramp. Meanwhile I, in my corduroy trousers and T-shirt, look as if I have fallen off the laundry cart. My trousers arephorenand the grey tee has an Airbus logo. Sadly, no one in my group seems to have any regard for the imported or even the aviation giant. Jessica Alba also wore a statement sweatshirt with a jacket thrown over it carelessly, and she made it to the top-whatever list of best-dressed travellers! Just saying. I think longingly of my first-ever flight in 1970: from Calcutta to Madras and from there to Bangalore. Nine-year-old me had really taken trouble with my appearance. A pink frock with an embroidered collar (from Calcutta’s Good Companions), polished school shoes and white lacy socks, matching hair clasps and a new hanky. Obviously, I was more stylish back then. Maybe, I should have just worn a sari. After all, you can’t go wrong with it. In response a young friend comments, “If I wear a sari, by the time I’m done with security, it would come off.” When did the sari become such a challenge?” After all, Miranda Kerr managed to carry off a ruffled, floor-length gown at Los Angeles airport. I enlist the help of designer Anand Kabra, known for his fondness for saris and the Indian silhouette in his designs. He starts off promisingly enough saying, “Look, I know a lot of women who are most comfortable in a sari. They can even run in one. If you have comfortable footwear, wear the sari just a little higher than you usually do. Wear a blouse that covers up nicely and frees you from hitching and tugging.” Layer up Kabra also suggest dressing in layers for comfort. “We move from outdoors into a climate-controlled environment, and then outdoors again. So layering makes sense. You can add or remove a jacket easily enough. It is the same with scarves. A few sensible ideas can keep you from looking unkempt when you arrive at your destination.” Obviously, crumple-free fabric is a must. “Stay away from cotton, please. Jersey is nice. It is soft, doesn’t crush and looks the same as it did when you put it on at the beginning of your journey.” While on the topic of layering, bomber jackets work beautifully. They are lightweight and make the wearer feel snug. It’s also a hot favourite among celebrities, right from Selena Gomez to Kendall Jenner. It easy to retain that air of understated elegance even when you travel, says designer Shilpa Reddy. Just follow a few basic rules to avoid being that malodorous grungy traveller that nobody wants to sit next to on the plane. “Comfort comes first, but surely there is nothing to stop you from looking good too,” she says. Reddy swears by a well-cut pair of black trousers in a knit fabric (the M&S kind). If you must wear track pants, find ones that have some detailing, like “a little embroidery, studs on the side or something that sets it apart from what you pull on for a jog. (But keep in mind the fact that those bedazzled velour Juicy Couture tracks teamed with oversized sunglasses have become stereotypical wannabe WAG wear.) Also remember, airports aren’t the best places to experiment with edgy new trends. We get it, a lot of you get excited about travelling, which could result in corsets, skinny jeans and stilettos on the flight. But do you really want to limp across terminals thanks to shoe bites from your latest acquisition? Or be strapped into your seat in tight, high-waist skinny jeans and an even tighter crop top? (Let there be enough space for the airline food and wine). And let’s not even get started on the acrobatics involved when you use a tiny airline toilet in a jumpsuit. Or go through security in knee-high boots. If you must be a flying fashionista, take a cue from Victoria’s Secret model Shanina Shaik, who slips into a comfy pair of sweat pants and hoodie during the flight, and then patiently changes back into her trendy ensemble just before she disembarks. Let’s face it: Looking good never comes easy! Feet first Now, for your feet. Comfortable footwear is all important. Since we are often asked to remove our shoes when we go through airport security these days, wear moccasins or, if you really want to make that style statement, a zippered pair of shoes, says Reddy. Heels and laced affairs are out. You don’t have to give up all accessories. She says, “I like wearing bracelets and rings. If they get too uncomfortable, you can always easily slip them off and put them into your bag. I also always have sunglasses.” Reddy says she carries a spare shirt and inner wear in her hand luggage. “So I can shower and change in transit lounges and arrive at my destination not just looking but also feeling fresh.” Stylist Shilpa Vummiti opts for soft leggings for their comfort and non-crumpling qualities. “They are light and no-nonsense and can be jazzed up with accessories such as bags, jewellery and shoes,” she says. Both Vummiti and Reddy recommend handbags big enough to hold travel essentials. Vummiti ensures that, just before landing, she washes her face thoroughly and removes all traces of make up. Reddy always double-checks the zipper on her bag. “A medium-sized bag is the perfect accessory. It can add style and is also functional. Inside, I keep see-through ziplock bags. I carry my face mist and hand cream in one, hair bands, combs, brushes and dry shampoo (hair gets rather limp in flight) in another, medicines and so on in a third.” Vummiti’s travel bag is “roomy enough for wet wipes, gum, lip balm and socks”. She adds, “It is considerate to use antiperspirant stick deodorant (not spray deodorants), as body odour is a big turn off. If you have to use a perfume, be kind and use something really mild.” Given how many people are allergic to the smell of jasmine and rose, it’s best to steer clear of these fragrances. You might love your Jean Paul Gaultier, but the passenger on 29 F may not think so. Dress sharp, and who knows, like designer Carolina Herrera once famously said in an interview to the Daily Mail , “You know, if you dress up at the airport, you will actually be taken care of perfectly. You’ll be the one who the stewards look after the most.” Maybe this is how you may just snag that upgrade you’ve been dreaming of. The diva dress list Rihanna made a splash with a big tote in tan, teamed with army camouflage trousers, a Harley-Davidson T-shirt and a leather jacket thrown over her shoulder. Sienna Miller wrapped a long blue scarf around her neck, wore a simple top and pulled it all together with black pencil trousers and strappy flat sandals. Kate Beckinsale picked her flesh-coloured satin pants. Don’t forget Comfortable footwear Crush-free fabrics A spare top/T-shirt and socks Shades to conceal smudged kohl and dark circles, thanks to lack of sleep Face mist, moisturisers and lip balm A bag that combines style with utility. Organise it well, so that you don’t have to grope around for what you need. A deodorant that is not overpowering Accessories like a beanie or a beret/hat to hide messy hair Numbers game Thanks to its extensive domestic routes, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International has been the world’s busiest airport since 1998, with more than 101 million passengers passing through its terminals in 2015 – that’s the equivalent of the population of Ethiopia.",0

Advani, on Monday urged the Election Commission declare “unconstitutional” any direction by a political party asking its legislators to abstain from the July 19 Presidential poll. In a six-page memorandum to the Chief Election Commissioner, which was submitted to Election Commissioner Navin Chawla, the NDA argued that since the legislators cast their vote as people’s representatives, it was their “constitutional obligation under Article 54 and 55” to exercise their franchise “purely” in their “individual capacity and as elected representatives of the people” and “not as members of a political party.” Asking them to abstain would be unconstitutional, as an MP or an MLA was “entitled to ignore” such direction. The delegation comprised NDA convener George Fernandes and BJP leaders Murli Manohar Joshi, Arun Jaitley and V.K. Malhotra. Mr. Jaitley told reporters that in the Presidential election there was no place for party symbol or party whip and the ballot was secret. Abstention meant that the entire population of a constituency goes unrepresented in the election. He admitted that there was no bar on “voluntary” abstention but pointed out that one cannot be coerced or “directed” by a political party to abstain. He wanted a clarification from the Election Commission as the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution makes a member vulnerable to disqualification if he or she votes or abstains from voting in a House contrary to his or her party’s directive. “Para 2 of the tenth Schedule treats either of such conduct [inside or outside the House] on a par,” the memorandum said. While MPs and MLAs of a party that has directed its members to abstain could invite disqualification under the Tenth Schedule, the MP or MLA who abstains in conformity with the direction issued by his or her party would be guilty of violating his constitutional obligation of representing his voters during the Presidential poll, the memorandum said. The issue came to the fore after the United National Progressive Alliance, comprising the All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Samajwadi Party, the TDP and others, publicly asked their members to abstain from voting.",0

The incident occurred in Sri Sadguru Sai Baba High School, Roopena Agrahara, on Friday afternoon. The incident triggered panic as it came less than a week after the Church Street blast that killed a 38-year-old woman. The incident was initially taken to be a bomb blast.

Acharya, appearing for Maudany, said there was no direct evidence to link his client with the blasts. He said that Maudany did not initially figure in the FIR. His name was only added subsequently. The court, however, observed that, “there is seldom direct evidence in such cases.” It said, conspiracy is generally hatched in complete secrecy as otherwise the whole purpose will be frustrated.” It said inference could be drawn from whatever evidence had been placed and collected and it was “sufficient to point out the conspiracy.” When it was pointed out that Maudany was ailing, the court directed the jail authorities in Bangalore where he is now housed to take steps to ensure that his health condition did not deteriorate and that he be provided all medical help. Earlier, the Advocate-General placed before the court details of Maudany's telephone records. The court took note of these records and said they pointed to a prima facie case against Maudany. It said though personal liberty was very important, the interest of the State also could not be lost sight of. If a case that involved the security of the State and the nation, bail was generally refused. This, it said, was one such case where the “interest of the nation can never be given up.”",1
465,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-year-of-living-dangerously/article16921718.ece,opinion,None,A year of living dangerously,"Pakistan’s decision not to respond to India’s surgical strikes after the terrorist attack on the Army base in Uri may have seemed at the time like a major political victory for the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi. But it is increasingly becoming evident that not only was the political victory short-lived, the country is paying a heavy price for the cross-LoC strike on September 29. While the Pakistan Army refused to admit that the surgical strikes ever took place, it has since been retaliating: unstated, surreptitiously and through proxies. Consider this: with Saturday’s attack on an Indian army convoy in Kashmir’s Pampore, the armed forces in Kashmir have lost over 60 men this year alone. Along with this disturbing rise in the attacks on Army camps across Jammu and Kashmir, the LoC and International Boundary (IB) in the State are also alarmingly tense today. Ceasefire violation-related military casualties on the Indian side itself are 12 so far, highest since the ceasefire agreement — which has all but collapsed now — was arrived at in 2003. Strategic implications of the strikes From a military point of view, the cross-LoC operation was limited and carefully calibrated: there was no targeting of Pakistani military installations as the operation was claimed to be against terror camps and not against the Pakistan Army, and the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) telephoned his Pakistani counterpart after the operations ended and conveyed the counter-terrorist intent behind the strike. The DGMO further clarified that the “Indian Army conducted surgical strikes at several of these launch pads ‘along’ Line of Control.” Moreover, the operation was hardly a surprise to Rawalpindi given the high level of political and military signalling from the Indian side between the Uri attack and the surgical strikes. The Pakistan Army is also said to have monitored a great deal of ‘operation-related chatter’ from the Indian side. Indeed, New Delhi’s post-strike triumphalism did have negative reputational impact on the all-powerful General Headquarters in Rawalpindi and for the Nawaz Sharif government in Islamabad. If so, why did the Pakistan Army not resist, or hit back after New Delhi hailed the military action as a blockbuster victory (even though we now know that such operations were conducted in the past as well)? Does this mean that Rawalpindi displayed a certain amount of tolerance for the Indian military action given that it was carried out after 19 Indian soldiers were killed, and national anger was mounting in India? I recently asked a senior (retired) Pakistani General about the ‘level of tolerance’ for potential surgical strike-like action in future by India. I was told rather bluntly that it would depend on the Pakistan Army’s complicity in the attack: the more the complicity, the less the retaliation. Or differently put, no complicity would mean definite retaliation. While this might appear to provide an operational window for future Indian military action across the LoC below the Pakistani redline, a proactive military strategy based on the assumption of Pakistani indulgence is rife with multiple challenges. First of all, it would be rather difficult to fix the degree of state complicity in an attack within a severely limited time frame for any retaliatory operation. The Pakistan Army’s tolerance, if it indeed exists, and international community’s acceptance would be time-sensitive. Second, local commanders along the LoC on the Pakistani side could misread the ‘accepted threshold’ assumption and act differently than expected when attacked. Third, the Indian side would, as it did post-surgical strikes, radically exaggerate the success of its retaliatory strike in order to show that the Pakistani tolerance level for Indian retaliation is high. The Pakistani side would, on the other hand, as it did post-surgical strikes, deny the operation altogether or lower its level and success (i.e. that operation was limited to the LoC only) to reduce the perceived level of Pakistani tolerance by India. Finding a via media between these two extreme positions for operational purposes is easier said than done, and trying to exploit that fine balance may be setting out on a dangerous course of action. Finally, that there was no vertical escalation after the surgical strikes even though this was an openly declared attack on Pakistan’s territory assumes a great deal of significance. While this might, at one level, go to show that the Indian and Pakistani sides are able to control the escalation dynamics under extreme stress, it would be wrong to assume that India’s cross-LoC operation has gone not responded to by Pakistan. Indeed, the response is currently playing out. Consider the following. The low-cost response Responding to the surgical strikes with matching force would not have been a smart strategy for Pakistan given that it would have been hard for Rawalpindi to pull it off. This, in my reckoning, perhaps explains the Pakistani inaction and the refusal to acknowledge the Indian attack. When you don’t acknowledge an action, you don’t have to react to it. However, the story doesn’t end there. Pakistan is currently responding to the Indian strikes in a way it is materially able to and ‘at a time and place of its choosing’: by firing on the border and organising coordinated attacks on Indian Army bases/convoys through its proxies such as the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. These two cheap strategies seem to essentially make up Rawalpindi’s response to New Delhi’s surgical strikes. India was highly emboldened by the Pakistan military’s non-retaliation after the September strikes but it is today recognising that while it may have pulled off the military action and the subsequent political management of it, the costs are mounting day after day. The LoC and the IB have become the new battlefield, and we should expect a lot more action along these borderlands in the days ahead. Both India and Pakistan seem to be using these contested borders as an arena for settling scores which they do not want to settle in a conventional pitched battle. In short, lower-level instability seems to be the order of the day in the near future. While border firing might seem less escalatory than cross-border raids, ceasefire violations are a slow killer: as ceasefire violation-related casualties continue to rise, they could lead to political and diplomatic escalation, and sustained violations together with covert cross-border raids (as it has happened more than once in the past) could potentially lead to vertical military escalation. The other cheap strategy in response to India’s surgical strikes seems to be well-planned low-intensity attacks on Indian forces in J&K. While border firing hurts both parties, low-intensity strikes (for example, Nagrota and Pampore) hurt only India since it loses soldiers in such raids, whereas Pakistan only loses expendable proxies. The argument here is not that such attacks against Army camps did not take place before September this year, but that they are likely to increase with more precision and determination in the days ahead. Moreover, thanks to the stand-off, Islamabad and Rawalpindi will continue to fan the Kashmir uprising with even more vigour. Notwithstanding the fact that the recent Kashmir uprising was essentially indigenous in nature, Pakistani grandstanding and renewed domestic political mobilisation within Pakistan over Kashmir, and the military strategising for a sustained Kashmir campaign will keep Kashmir on the boil. Pakistan’s adoption of such low-cost strategies to respond to India’s surgical strikes also lands the Modi government in a rather awkward commitment trap. Though the post-Uri strikes and the political posturing by the Bharatiya Janata Party were supposed to convey to Rawalpindi, and the domestic audience in India that attacks on Indian forces won’t go unpunished anymore, the reality is that both the Nagrota and Pampore attacks have gone unpunished. This leaves the Modi government in a strategic quandary: it has neither been able to live up to its commitment nor has its threats been able to dissuade the Pakistan Army. If anything, the Pakistan Army seems to have called the Modi government’s bluff. National security implications The current stand-off with Pakistan has drastically deteriorated our overall national security environment. Our soldiers in the north-western frontier are far more in danger today than they had been in recent years. The precious lives of soldiers would have been saved had New Delhi avoided an unnecessarily aggressive policy in J&K and towards Pakistan. There is also growing disquiet within the Indian armed forces about the needless loss of lives because politicians are unwilling to reach a modus vivendi on political issues both within Kashmir and vis-à-vis Pakistan. Besides the military casualties, there is yet another form of collateral damage: the lives and livelihoods of people living along the border. Despite the recurrent hardship that they have to go through, villagers don’t speak out in public thanks to the extreme levels of right-wing political mobilisation in Jammu. Suffering and death are couched in the language of deshbhakti (patriotism). In private, however, they recount the untold miseries due to ceasefire violations. The year-long violations in 2014, for instance, had displaced them for several months. This is a collateral damage that goes unsung and unacknowledged.

After the signing of the accord, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that the political impasse in the hill areas was on its way to being ended and that the “matter [was] settled.” But the GJM said that part of the consensus was that the new set-up would be formed “without diluting” its main agenda for a Gorkhaland state, though the demand had been set aside for now. Barely an hour after Ms. Banerjee described the agreement as “historical” and the culmination of a prolonged agitation by the GJM, party general secretary Roshan Giri told The Hindu:“It has been reiterated in the minutes of today's meeting that the main agenda of Gorkhaland must not be diluted or prejudiced.” “It has been made clear that there can be an agreement for a bigger, more powerful body to replace the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council without diluting our main agenda for a separate State,” he said. It was agreed after more than three hours of talks — first between the GJM leaders and the State government represented by, among others, Chief Secretary Samar Ghosh and Home Secretary G.D. Gautama, and then a brief round of discussions with the Chief Minister — that a new elected body would be set up for the Darjeeling hills even as a nine-member high-level committee comprising representatives of the Centre, the State government and the GJM looked into the question of bringing the Gorkha-dominated areas in the Dooars and the Terai under its jurisdiction. It would submit its recommendations within six months. The talks between the GJM and the officials resumed during the day after they ended inconclusively on Monday. The new setup would have full administrative, financial and executive powers and would be given more autonomy than the DGHC, Mr. Ghosh said. Once a tripartite agreement involving the Centre was formalised, a Bill would be introduced in the Assembly at the earliest, so that the process of election for the new body could be initiated. Till the body was set up, a five-member committee would constitute a board of administrators to oversee the development process in the hills. Another committee would be set up to look into the GJM's demand for investing the body with the authority for land management of tea-gardens and submit its recommendations within two weeks. Pointing out that with the “official-level agreement” the “burning issue of Bengal” had finally been addressed, the Chief Minister said she had informed Union Home Minister P Chidambaram that “the matter has been settled.” The State would seek an early round of tripartite talks — if possible within a week — to be held in Darjeeling to put the final seal of approval on the settlement, Ms. Banerjee said. Asked what the magic formula was applied to arrive at an agreement, she said: “It is development. We have to give more importance to Darjeeling… It is a both-side [two-way] traffic, not a one-side traffic.' Expressing satisfaction with the outcome of the talks, Mr. Giri said: “Some of the contentious issues [of the seven points raised] have been resolved.” Senior GJM leader Harka Bahadur Chettri described the new council as a “foundation for Gorkhaland.”",0
471,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-quest-for-identity/article7021469.ece,features,metroplus,A quest for identity,"A commercial film works like a mathematical formula, carefully planned to please a star’s fan base, with handpicked ingredients that will appeal to the urban, semi-urban and rural pockets. It doesn’t matter if the story is as old as the hills. Rarely do we come across a film that deviates from these norms and urges viewers to do the same. Debut director Nag Ashwin’s Yevade Subramanyam is that rare film. Somewhere in the Himalayas, Subramanyam (Nani) is clinging to a precipice and hoping for a miracle. His spectacles falls into the deep valley and all he can think of is Rs. 20-22,000 he spent on it. Much later, he would admit to his mountaineering companion Anandi (Malavika Nair) that he really didn’t need glasses. He sports them because he read that there’s an eight per cent chance that people take you more seriously. This Subramanyam is your regular Joe, focussed on climbing the corporate ladder. A snow-capped mountain peak is the last place where you expect to find him. Nag Ashwin throws his protagonist out of his comfort zone and makes him search for his identity. There’s a bit of Subramanyam in most of us — living by a timetable, doing things to fall into a pattern acceptable by society. Every now and then a friend would have nudged us to drive home the pointlessness of it all; when was the last time we took a road to nowhere and savoured each moment of the experience. Subramanyam’s childhood friend Rishi (Vijay Devarakonda) is a polar opposite to the corporate climber, is not tied down by a job and dreams of heading to Doodh Kashi, a lake in the Himalayas. It seems impractical, even foolish, when he keeps egging Subramanyam to accompany him. The two chance upon Anandi, another free-spirited soul who likes Rishi’s idea. The trip, when it eventually happens, occurs without Rishi. The little details that have gone into the characterisation of Rishi, Subramanyam and Anandi speak of Nag Ashwin’s mettle. Subramanyam, the reluctant mountaineer, thinks he can navigate the steep slopes with a Google map, embarks on the trip with a large suitcase while Anandi, with her backpack, is thrilled at the adventure ahead. Up in the mountains, eating a basic meal of momos and learning to find comfort in the smallest of accommodations, Subramanyam learns to look at the larger picture. His transformation takes time and he begins to understand where he stands in life, death and love beyond the rat race. To strike a comparison, Subramanyam is like Hrithik Roshan of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara , who planned to work and earn till a certain age and then savour life. What if life doesn’t wait for him? Nag Ashwin sprinkles Yevade… with interesting characters. There’s Pratap Pothen who observes the cycle of life in a butterfly park and there’s the spirited Sowcar Janaki who basks in the loving care of Anandi. There’s also a potential business rival who doesn’t think much of losing the company he built over the years. It’s as though Subramanyam is given enough signs to take the path of self discovery. Nani is a fine actor and lives the part of Subramanyam, mirroring the insecurities of the work force caught in a rat race. As he sheds the corporate mask, he comes into his own, one step at a time on the mountains. Malavika Nair shows a lot of spunk and comes up with a matured performance for a newcomer. Vijay Devarakonda has been cast well and fits the bill of a rebel. The pace slows down a bit in some portions, but that’s perhaps the way this story needed to be told, drawing in viewers to savour the experience. The writing is sparkling with smart, fun lines peppered through the film. The cinematography complements the proceedings. Radhan’s music and background score comes alive, changing according to the terrain. There’s a bonus track from Ilayaraja as well, beautifully capturing the budding romance between two unlikely characters thrown together in a journey. Go watch Yevade Subramanyam . If you like the idea of breaking free and living by your own rules, you’ll nod in agreement.",0

Announcing this at the monthly meeting of the Vellore Corporation Council here on Thursday, Mr. Khan said that under the scheme the slums would be replaced either with individual houses if the owner has sufficient land or two-storeyed apartments if the land was not sufficient. In the case of those who have land but no decent dwelling, houses would be constructed for them. Making a detailed statement about the scheme at the meeting on the invitation of the Vellore Corporation, R. Ravikumar, Assistant Executive Engineer, TNSCB, Salem said that the objective of the scheme was to provide basic amenities such as water, drainage and a pucca shelter to slum-dwellers who lacked these amenities in their existing dwellings. The TNSCB official said that in the first phase, the Board would take a satellite picture of the Vellore Corporation area, create a baseline and prepare a map of each slum area in the Corporation limits. With the help of these pictures and maps, the Board would identify the slum areas and facilities such as drainage and water supply and provide these to the areas which lacked them along with the pucca houses to be built for them. A socio-economic survey of each slum-dweller family would be undertaken along with the main survey, and the data obtained fed into the computer with the help of the software developed by the Central government. The survey would cover slums on objectionable land, poromboke and private land. Mr. Ravikumar said that once the survey is over, either pucca houses would be constructed or existing houses upgraded. If anyone has a slum on a patta land, it would be upgraded into a pucca house, while those living on poromboke land would be relocated to apartments to be built for them in a separate site. Fifty percent of the cost of each house would be borne by the Central government, 40 per cent by the State government and the remaining 10 per cent by the owner. After assessing the needs, the Board would seek funds from the Central government to undertake the task of construction of houses or apartments. The scheme aims not only at constructing alternative pucca houses for the slum-dwellers but also at developing the surrounding areas which includes construction of retention walls wherever necessary to prevent entry of rainwater into the houses. The TNSCB official sought the cooperation of the councillors for the survey to be undertaken for the purpose, which would enumerate the slums built on encroached government poromboke or Corporation land as well as the slums built on encroachments which were regularised later.",0

He also agreed that he was taken to the office of a news channel where he was shown video footage of Nanda before recording of his statement. ‘Delay in recording statement’ Kulkarni also told the court that the police deliberated for two days and then recorded his statement under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code. He told the court that the then public prosecutor in the case and the police deliberated on whether to book Nanda for murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The eyewitness also alleged that an officer of the Assistant Commissioner level beat up him mercilessly before his statement was recorded. When asked for the reason, Kulkarni said he was not sure if the officer was forcing him to stick to his earlier statement or change it. Kulkarni has changed his statements many times during the course of the trial. Meanwhile, recording of the statement of Kulkarni and his cross-questioning by the prosecution and defence ended on Thursday. The court had summoned him as a witness when the other main witnesses had turned hostile. He had earlier been dropped by the prosecution as “unreliable”. Sting operation During this period, Kulkarni was also instrumental in getting a sting operation conducted by a television news channel in which the then Public Prosecutor in the case, I. U. Khan, and defence counsel R. K. Anand were shown purportedly discussing with him ways to bail out Nanda against monetary consideration. Both lawyers had to leave their briefs and the Delhi High Court also ordered an inquiry into the sting operation.",0

Municipal Commissioner Md. Abdul Azeem urged the employees to suspended their protest, and attend to their duties. The JAC members submitted a memorandum to him asking the VMC to pay the salaries immediately and clear the terminal benefits, pensions, medical reimbursements and PF part final and loan payments. Mr. Azeem told them that the issue would be brought to the notice of district Collector M. Buddha Prakash Jyothi, who is also the Special Officer for the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation. The matter would be escalated to Principal Secretary and the Municipal Administration Minister, he said. Mr. Azeem said everyone is aware that the contractors were on agitation mode. A fellow in their community breathed his last. The image of the corporation would be at stake if everyone goes on strike or protest, he said, adding, “I am caught between the devil and the deep sea.” The issues raised by both of you (contractors and employees) are genuine. As a commissioner both issues have to be sorted out, he said, adding, “You know that I assumed the office when finances were red. I don’t have a magic wand to do wonders. I need some breathing space to set the things right. Till then, cooperate.” ‘Assurance needed’ The JAC convener Eswar, however, said that they cannot suspend their work to rule unless there was a categorical assurance on the salaries. “The JAC has decided to go on work to rule in any given month if the salaries were not paid on first day of that month. The members will not keep quiet if the protest was withdrawn without any assurance. There are two festivals -- one in this month, and another in next month. Consider the plight of the employees as well,” he said. The JAC leader said that they were not against the payments to the contractors. The employees’ pension contribution, Provident Fund (PF) and Gundala layout development fund were diverted to meet the contractors pending bills. JAC members submit a memorandum to municipal Commissioner ‘I need some breathing space to set the things right,’ he says",1

Housing for all, one of the vision statements of the Prime Minister, can be fulfilled only by building 2 crore houses in urban areas and 4 crore houses in rural areas. Infrastructure is the key for economic growth. However, there has been a major slippage on this front over the last decade or so.Investment in infrastructural sector has, therefore, been stepped up by Rs. 70,000 crore in the year 2015-16 over the previous year. Connecting each of the 1,78,000 unconnected habitations in India with all-weather roads will require completion of 1 lakh km of such roads. Our infrastructure does not match our growth ambitions and needs massive public investments. Towards this end, the Finance Minister has proposed increased outlays on roads by Rs. 14,031 crore and Rs. 10,050 crore for railways during the year. Keeping all the requirements under the infrastructure head, establishment of a National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) with an annual flow of Rs. 20,000 crore has been proposed in the current budget. The PPP model will be revamped whereby the public investment will be stepped up substantially. Revival In order to release / raise funds, the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) provided in the 2014-15 budget and acclaimed as major vehicles for fund raising, will be allowed partial ‘pass throughs’. This will trigger a major role in reviving construction activity. Another proposal to raise funds is reintroduction of tax-exempted infrastructure development bonds. Let us look at the implications of the housing and infrastructure thrust to the economy in general and real estate sector in particular. The thrust in the two areas will in itself trigger massive all-round construction activity, which will generate employment and enhance usage of primary raw materials like steel and cement. The National Housing Bank and the Infrastructure Finance companies will be able to provide both direct and refinance by taking advantage of the NIIF. Some dampeners The increase in excise duty, coupled with freight increase as proposed in the railway budget, will make cement / steel dearer, though only marginally, increasing the cost of construction to that extent. For individual home buyers, without special treatment for affordable housing or increased deductions, the urge for more investment may be halted at least initially. As a part of curbing black money within the country, the proposal to introduce a comprehensive Benami Transactions ( prohibition) Bill is likely to act as a ‘caution’ to real estate investors though this is in national interest. The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act to prohibit acceptance of advance of Rs. 20,000 or more in cash for purchase of immovable property may be another minor hassle. The budget proposals can be considered quite encouraging to the real estate sector.",0

485,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/Cloning-originals/article14501130.ece,features,fridayreview,Cloning originals,"Each of us likes to think we are unique and different from the rest. Yet few of us can take on the label of being ‘original’. Adam Grant a professor at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania tells you how to become original (an oxymoron?) and even recognize the true original from the one faking it. Grant says, “Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them.” The first point that Grant makes is to do with procrastination, “…we designed some experiments. We asked people to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are. And some of them are asked to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough, the moderate procrastinators are 16 per cent more creative than the other two groups….Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing these experiments, I was starting to write a book about originals, and I thought, ‘This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter on procrastination.’ So I meta-procrastinated, and like any self-respecting procrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate…and one day –– I was halfway through –– I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it, I had all sorts of new ideas. And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal…what about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before the biggest speech of his life, he was up past 3 a.m., rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history: ‘I have a dream.’ That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise…” Grant says the originals also suffer from doubt but, “I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt… There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine... And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four. Instead of saying, ‘I'm crap,’ you say, ‘The first few drafts are always crap, and I'm just not there yet’.” Grant concludes, “Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they're even more afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science, are the chances not taken.” Take time initially and do not be in a hurry to finish your task, doubt your idea to refine it and do not be afraid to take chances…then we can clone many originals! sudhamahi@gmail.com Web link: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_ habits_of_original_thinkers Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them.

486,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/Sacred-voices-from-the-past/article16189534.ece,features,fridayreview,Sacred voices from the past,"A glittering visual configuration that stirred the consciousness, ‘Pannum Bharatamum' was a dance feature on the Thevaram. Choreographed and presented by veteran dancer Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam and her disciples, it was organised by Sri Krishna Gana Sabha for the Yagnaraman July Fest. The production featuring select works of Tamil Saivaite saints Appar, Tirugnanasambandar, Sundarar and Manickavachagar, has grown from strength to strength in more ways than one since it was first staged in 1984. Not surprisingly, the choreography and the performance boasted of different planes of interpretation. A master of bhava, Padma demonstrated just how hyperbole and subtlety, humour and solemnity can accentuate the sacred voices. The extensive artistic and scholastic skills of the veteran dancer streamed the Thevaram into a wholesome experience of rasa. Split second timing and coordination by dancers Aparna, Swati, Nivedita, Mahati Kannan, Ramya, Srinidhi, Anugraha and Neeraja emphasised their effervescent dancing. The group's seamless integration of adavus and charis underscored their teacher's well-known viewpoint in dance. While their costumes were colourful, the multiplicity in designs jarred. For the most part, the programme was charted so that a group piece was alternated with a solo number by Padma. The initial piece ‘Purvarangam' performed by the entire group was followed by Appar's words which recounted how he quelled the five senses to seat Lord Siva in his heart. Myriad moods In the next number, one could only marvel at the innumerable ways Padma coaxed the stubborn parrot, fondly addressed as ‘madakiliye' by Tirugnanasambandar, in Suddha Saveri. This piece has been performed by the dancer numerous times before, yet it retained its sparkle so that the anticipation held sway for the audience until the parrot finally uttered the sacred name. Memories of Padma taking wing with the unique karnas to depict the parrot, came together with that evening's exposition of the maiden's attempts to hear her beloved's name. Typical of her approach, here too one saw Padma's diversity of emotions, ranging from wonder and fear to love and devotion, adding strength and patina. Resplendent in her white and gold costume, Padma's specialised body stances brought home the majesty of Siva, who burnt Tripura with his third eye and as the one who showered his grace on the true devotee for Sundaramurthy's Thevaram. A highlight Among the many depictions, ‘Sambho Mahadeva' struck a special note. This Sundarar lyric that came at the tail end saw the veteran dancer pour out the frustrations of the bhakta. She confronted a God who remained deaf to repeated pleas for salvation. Even as her body language outlined that this was no meek or humble missive, the rasika was made clearly alive of the extraordinary familiarity of Sundarar for whom Siva was an inseparable friend. Another solo number that struck a poignant note was in Kaapi, performed by Mahati Kannan whose eloquent eyes outlined the naiveté of the girl who is mesmerised by Siva as the alms seeker. The superb quality of music in the form of vocals and nattuvangam of Gayatri and Radhika, and sensitive music by veena vidwan Kannan added to the flamboyance of the evening, especially as the orchestra gallantly followed the doyenne's improvisations.",0

The Gandhi Park stand, to come up before the Attukal Pongala festival, will be among 10 proposed prepaid stands that will come up in the city Corporation area and be monitored by the city police. City Police Commissioner P. Vijayan said increasing the number of prepaid auto stands was one of the priority activities for the city police this year. The idea of prepaid auto stands, jointly implemented by the Corporation and the city police, has been quite successful in the city, where there are tales galore of passengers being taken for a ride in the absence of any monitoring system or fixed tariffs. There are four stands functioning in the city as of now, two of them at Thampanoor — at the Central railway station and the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation bus-station; one near the Medical College; and one at the Pettah railway station. P. Mohanan, Assistant Commissioner, Traffic (South), said that after the stand near Gandhi Park came up, efforts would be made to set up another near General Hospital. At General Hospital The demand for a stand at General Hospital was long-standing, but the availability of land had been a stumbling block. The issue had been taken up with the Health Minister for discussion with the Health Department, he said. Another prepaid stand would start functioning soon near Technopark, with the Kazhakuttam police to monitor it. This too followed high demand, mostly from techies. A stand was on the anvil near the Kochuveli railway station as well, Mr. Mohanan said. P. Bijoy, Assistant Commissioner (Control Room), said that the prepaid auto stands, particularly the one at the Pettah railway station, were turning out to be not only successes, but also a major relief to the people. In the days before the stand came up, even police personnel used to find it difficult to get transport if they got down at the Pettah station at night. “Now we are insisting that the autorickshaws designated to operate from the prepaid stand be present on the station premises at night as well, in tune with the train timings,” Mr. Bijoy said. Pointing out that space was the only constraint for the prepaid stand sites proposed by the Corporation, Mr. Bijoy said the stands were another mode of security for late-night passengers, with round-the-clock presence of a policeman in the area. 10 prepaid stands proposed in Corporation limits Four stands are functioning at present",0

The agitators took out a procession from Mahaveer Circle which passed through the main streets of the city and culminated outside the deputy commissioner’s office. They formed a human chain at Vanaki Obavva Circle hampering vehicular movement for over 30 minutes. Terming this as the government selling out to the managements of private medical and engineering colleges, and not safeguarding the interests of poor, meritorious students, the protesters alleged that their academic future was now at the mercy of these managements. They said that poor, meritorious students would be losing 45 per cent of medical seats, 40 per cent of engineering seats and 35 per cent of dental seats under the government quota in professional colleges run by private managements. Now along with their quota of seats, private managements would fill up 85 per cent of the seats in professional colleges by conducting entrance examinations through the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka (COMEDK). The agitators alleged that there had been several complaints about the entrance examination conducted by the COMEDK in the previous years. Students from Karnataka would not get their due share in admission to professional colleges as the track record showed that majority of the seats were filled by students from other States, a large number of whom write the entrance examination conducted by COMEDK. The students said the government would now conduct the Common Entrance Test (CET) through the Karnataka Examinations Authority to fill up 5,000 seats in government medical and engineering colleges, while 75,000 seats in private medical and engineering colleges would be filled through the entrance examination conducted by COMEDK, they added. The agitators submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah through Deputy Commissioner V.P. Ikkeri and warned of intensifying their agitation if the government failed to withdraw its decision to implement the Act. PU college bandh Bellary Staff Correspondent reports: The All-India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) has given a call for PU college bandh on Saturday to protest against the government decision to implement the Karnataka Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Determination of Fee) Act, 2006. Govind, president of the district unit of AIDSO, said that the Act would withdraw merit seats in all private professional colleges, according to a release. The bandh call was to pressurise the government to retain the merit quota in private professional colleges and also to ensure that fees would be affordable to common man. Procession Davangere Staff Correspondent reports: Students, under the banner of All-India Democratic Students Organisation, took out a procession here on Friday. They raised slogans against the government for allowing private professional colleges to ‘rob’ parents. The students held demonstrations at the Gandhi Circle. Later, they submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner. The students said the Act would have a disastrous impact on the future of students coming from poorer sections of society. The State government has taken the decision at the behest of a few Congress leaders who owned private engineering and medical colleges, the students said. A student who secures first rank in the Common Entrance Test will have to invariably spend an exorbitant amount to get admission in a prestigious college. Don’t meritorious students deserve privileges for their hard work, they asked.",1

Mani. LDF MLAs, other representatives of the people, and LDF leaders from the district took part in the dharna. Inaugurating the dharna, State secretary of the Communist Party of India C.K. Chandrappan said the United Democratic Front (UDF) government seemed to have declared a war on the people through its revised Budget. There should be a mass movement cutting across political divide to effectively counter the challenges posed by the Budget, he said. Mr. Chandrappan said the proposals in the revised budget had triggered widespread protests all over the State. It not only lacked clarity but had even torpedoed the declared policies of the UDF. He said the budget had failed to grasp the problems of the State. The issue of food security and price control had not been addressed. Even the Onam mela centres had virtually no stock of essential commodities. Addressing the dharna, the former Education Minister and Kundara MLA M.A.. Baby said the revised Budget had drawn a unprecedented wave of protests. Even the ruling side had expressed its reservation and the UDF was forced to call a meeting to discuss the issues pertaining to the budget. The former Minister for Water Resources N.K. Premachandran said the cashew processing sector had been completely ignored in the budget. He alleged that the provision to exempt cashew plantations from the purview of land reforms was intended to help the private sector retain excess land. All proposals for road renovation and development in the last Budget of the previous LDF government had been deleted. The former Agriculture Minister and Chadayamangalam MLA Mullakara Ratnakaran said though Mr. Mani was well experienced in preparation of budget proposals, the revised budget had not gone much beyond Kottayam district. The budget lacked a justified distribution. Kollam had been totally ignored ostensibly because the district had largely stood by the LDF in the last Assembly elections, he alleged.

PMK leader S. Ramadoss, party MP Anbumani Ramadoss, MDMK general secretary Vaiko, senior BJP leader L. Ganesan and DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin prefer one-on-one talk shows, instead. The DMK and the AIADMK have nominated a panel of speakers to represent the party in these debates. Actor-turned-politician Vijayakant’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) is probably the only party that has kept away from television debates. “There was a time many senior leaders showed enormous interest in participating in these debates. But their initial enthusiasm seemed to have evaporated. They prefer to stay away because they have reservation in sharing dais with those who cannot match their stature,” said M. Gunasekaran, who moderates a primetime debate on Puthiya Thalaimurai. Egos apart, many leaders do not like to be caught in a tight spot, likely to be created by the representative of a rival political party who has come with an agenda. “But many well-read personalities and ideologues, including Arunan, Suba. Veerapandian, BJP leader H. Raja, CPI national leader D. Raja and Pazha Nedumaran, never bothered about who is going to sit with them on the panel,” added Mr. Gunasekaran. A moderator of debates on another popular channel felt “image” matters a lot to the high-profile political leaders and even before agreeing to sit on a panel they would seek to ensure that the other panelists enjoyed a status on a par with them. “Still, we have succeeded in bringing leader like Subramanian Swamy, M.K. Stalin and Anbumani Ramadoss to our studios. But they would present their point of view and leave the studio without taking part in the debate,” he said.",0

Chanting is done by repeating the name or names or mantras over and over again. Keep your voice low, strong and controlled. Aim at an even pace. You can start slowly and gradually increase your speed. Don’t hold your breath. Breathe naturally and normally. Gods’ names Every religion acknowledges the power of the name of God. Chanting, the glorification of God through His names is one of the ancient and universal practices of meditation. You could chant the name of any God you relate to. Start slowly and then increase the time and the speed. Om chanting Om is the only universal sound which is within every word and within everything. Om contains the entire spectrum of sound, words, worlds, and concepts. Om represents the source of all light, love, and wisdom. When you chant Om, you become one with all energy and all forms of this universe. While reciting Om concentrate on the space between your eyebrows. Feel Om. Think that you are all-knowing, eternal and free. When you chant Om you feel the vibrations through your entire body and mind. Each Om will take six seconds or more. The sound of Om in Sanskrit is AUM- A as in account, U as in would and M as in hum. Inhale deeply. When you exhale, start chanting AUM. Start the sound A from your navel, U in your chest to your lips and M to the crown of your head which is in turn felt in every cell of your body. Repeat. There should be silence between two successive Oms. The sound of Om calms, energises and heals. Buddhist chanting Daimoku – Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo This is what I discovered recently and its working wonders for me. This is by far the most powerful mantra I have known. Nichiren, a Japanese Buddhist priest (1222-1282) declared that all of the benefits of the wisdom contained in the Lotus Sutra can be realized by chanting nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The meaning of the mantra is- Nam- Devotion to, Myoho- the mystic law ( the law of life) , Renge- of the lotus ( karma) Kyo- the teaching itself ( of Budhha) You can download the mantra from >http://www.guernsey.net/~moorman/HOW_TO_CHANT.html to help you to start. Sit on a chair or on the floor, keep your eyes open and focused on a blank wall to avoid distraction. Clasp your hands together. Before starting, fix your mind on something you want to achieve. Whatever is important to you! Start chanting. You can chant at about one-and-a-half seconds per Daimoku or 40 Daimoku per minute. Choose the speed you feel comfortable with. Again how long to do it, how often and when is entirely up to you. Ideally it has to be chanted twice a day for 10- 15 minutes each. Time doesn’t matter.Through meditation we realise our personal responsibility for, and possibility to change everything within and around us. Let’s make our mind strong and calm so nothing is impossible to achieve. Even our inner peace!

Harish Rao has sought the cooperation of legislators and other elected representatives to make the third phase of Mission Kakatiya programme a success. The flagship programme of the State Government is to be launched soon with improved action plan based on the experience of the first two phases. The Minor Irrigation Department has selected 6,635 tanks for restoration under the third phase. Estimates were prepared for all the selected tanks by January-end and proposals of 6,231 tanks were sent to the government for clearance. Works pertaining to about 4,000 tanks have already been given administrative approval and the process for grounding of works is under way. In a letter addressed to all the legislators, members of Legislative Assembly and Council, Mr. Harish Rao said that for 17,000 tanks, administrative approval was given in the first two phases for their restoration with Rs. 5,660 crore. Apart from de-silting the tank beds, restoration of feeder channels and field channels, repairs to sluices, spillways and structures including constructing new ones wherever necessary, removal of jungle on the tank bunds and water haycinth, identification of foreshore areas and plantation in the foreshore areas and below tank bunds were being taken up under the programme, the Minister stated. Of the tanks taken for restoration under the first two phases, works pertaining to 11,400 tanks were completed so far and the engineers were directed to complete the works on the remaining 5,600 tanks by May-end. With the help of online system both for tenders process and bill payment, the government had cleared Rs. 2,000 crore bills so far.

Ram Mahesh Umpires may begin to lose the ability to respond spontaneously GALLE: Sri Lanka’s mastery over India in the first Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) in Colombo wasn’t confined to batting, bowling, and catching; the host’s use of the umpire referral system was better thought-out as well. The system raised several points of interest. For one, it exposed the hypothesis that the use of technology will eradicate umpiring errors. For another, it confirmed that the perfect decision is no nearer with the sophistication of technology. There is no such thing as the perfect decision, never has been; there are merely obvious decisions (in that they are immediately perceptible) and ones that need informed judgment. Real objective Fortunately, the ICC’s ambitions were modest. “We mustn’t forget what the real objective of this process is,” said ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson. “That is to avoid obvious and clear mistakes.” For an innovation to succeed, particularly one that involves so critical a facet, it must be demonstrably better than the system preceding it. Which, in this case, translates to umpire referrals leading to consistently better informed decisions in a manner that is fair to both sides. The evidence of the first Test suggests that there certainly will be more information available to the umpires. But while that will help some decisions, it will confuse others. The system is defined and thus limited by the technology, its set-up, and its interpretation. “The technology might be accurate, but it is only as accurate as it is set up,” said Richardson. The referrals involving Tillakaratne Dilshan (first innings) and Virender Sehwag (second) were two instances where the on-field umpire may have been better off trusting his intuition. Dilshan immediately asked for a review of a caught-behind decision. This implies that he was convinced he hadn’t nicked it. Strange as it may seem, there are rare occasions when even the batsman isn’t aware — and this has happened in international cricket. The technology officially used to determine nicks involves slow motion replays and the sounds from the stump microphones. Neither was conclusive in this instance. Yet Snickometer, which isn’t being used because its accuracy isn’t beyond doubt, registered a spike in sound as the ball passed the bat, the sort that corresponds, we are told, to bat hitting ball. Now there were other sounds involved — just to illustrate the complexity inherent, consider what Michael Holding, one of cricket’s most intuitive minds, said during a similar instance. On crumbling surfaces, he said he had seen pieces of soil — loosened by the ball pitching on the playing strip — hitting the bat and producing a similar sound to a nick. The point being made here is that the umpire went against his instinct, reversing the decision because technology offered no conclusive proof to support either case. A similar reversal of a decision made by instinct occurred in the Sehwag case. The ball shaved the front pad before hitting the back pad. The ball-tracking technology didn’t seem to register this deviation. The impact on the back pad showed the batsman was in front. But when it had hit the front pad, the off-break, which turned barely a smidge, couldn’t conclusively have been deemed to be heading towards the stumps. May over-think Decision-making involves complexity — much like batting. Batsmen perform best when in the zone, when they can’t cognitively access how their mind works. The best results in umpiring seem to spring from a similar state of mind, from intuition. With the referral system, umpires may begin to over-think, and lose the ability to respond spontaneously. It is a difficult balance to achieve. The ICC must test Hot Spot, the technology based on thermal images, and remain open to any other that improves the information available. The most evolved system with the technology currently available will involve the television umpire intervening only in the most obvious cases, and trusting the instincts of his on-field colleagues when the technology is inconclusive.",0

Southern Railway is all set to replace conventional toilets with bio-toilets in all coaches of trains passing through this section (excluding Tiruchi railway junction). Already, Madurai Division of Southern Railway chugged on with the honour of creating the first-ever green corridor of the country’s railway network between Manamadurai and Rameswaram in 2016. Along with the 114-km-long track of first green corridor, the new section will make Tiruchi-Manamadurai-Rameswaram line the longest green corridor of Indian Railways, running to a distance of 265 km. “At present, all the trains, except Pallavan Express, that pass through this section have been provided with bio-toilets. The retrofitment of bio-toilets in this train is under way at Madurai Railway Depot,” said Senior Divisional Mechanical Engineer Jay Prakash. All the four toilets of each of the 24 coaches would be fitted with the undergear tank for bio-toilets along with strengthening of undergear and modification of pipelines. “It takes at least two days for the retrofitment work in each of the coaches. We are expected to complete the work in two months,” he added. With introduction of bio-toilets that decompose human waste with bacteria, all the toilets in the trains and platforms in railway stations would not be reeking of foul smell. “The work of cleaning platforms of night soil will be done away with, giving a better and hygienic atmosphere,” he added. The night soil that splashes on the tracks and undergear of trains also slowly corrodes them. “Now corrosion will be prevented and the tracks and undergear of trains will require less maintenance and will have longer life,” he added. Madurai Division is also planning to make Manamadurai-Madurai and Manamadurai-Virudhunagar sections green corridors in phases.",0

Advises Govt. to hold in-depth consultations on issuesNeed for discussing service conditions of employees NEW DELHI: With the bank unions up in arms against the move, a Parliamentary panel has advised the Central Government to work out a consensus on the proposal to set up a company for taking over the country's existing retail payment systems. As per the proposal, a National Payments Corporation is to be set up to take over the job of various retail payments such as manual paper-based clearing, cheque clearing, electronic funds transfer (EFT) and card-based paper system. The proposed corporation is to be set up under Sec. 25 of the Companies Act, under which the profits earned are not to be paid out but ploughed back for further development of the payment systems. The bank unions, including the Reserve Bank Officers and Employees Unions, however, are apprehensive that the take-over of the clearing functions by the payments corporation would result in loss of income for public sector banks and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The unions are also against the move owing to fears of adverse implications on secrecy and confidentiality. In its report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday relating to the Payment and Settlement Systems Bill, 2006, the Standing Committee on Finance has advised the Government to hold wider and in-depth consultations on the entire range of issues pertaining to the proposed corporation. The committee, headed by BJP member and former Union Minister Ananth Kumar pointed out that issues such as the business model of the corporation, the terms and conditions of licensing and the service conditions of employees now engaged in clearing house operations should be discussed in detail for evolving a consensus on the proposal. Although the proposed National Payments Corporation of India is not part of the provisions of the Bill, it is indicated in the `Statement of objects and reasons' of the Bill that the company would take over the operation of retail payment systems in the country. In a dissent note to the committee's recommendations, Lok Sabha member Rupchand Pal has pointed out that with the setting up of such a corporation, the ""whole payment and settlement system would be done by private entities (companies) only'' and thus stand outsourced in the ""no so distant future.''",0

Participating in a discussion organised at the Gandhi Bhavan here, representatives of the Corporation of Cochin, traffic police, residents' associations, trade bodies, the private bus operators' association, NGOs and other organisations demanded speedy completion of the Corporation's Padma Junction-Pullepady-Thammanam-Chakkaraparambu and the Mamangalam-Goshree road-widening projects. Widen MG Road They also demanded that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) build the Salim Rajan Road-Rajaji Road flyover and widen the Banerjee Road and MG Road before pulling down the North overbridge. A couple of speakers were critical of the National Highways Authority of India's (NHAI) inability in building the flyovers proposed at Edapally, Palarivattom, Vytilla and Kundanoor, about a decade since they were mooted. The inordinate delay by the PWD (NH wing) in building the approach roads to the Edapally overbridge too was widely criticised. The Assistant Commissioner of Police (City Traffic), A.R. Premkumar said that the police have submitted details of roads and junctions which must be widened and tarred before pulling down the North bridge. “We have also sought sign boards and equipment which we would need, prior to diverting vehicles. Buses would be allowed in either direction through the bridge when the side bays are pulled down and other vehicles would be diverted.” The chairman of the Corporation's Town Planning Standing Committee K.J. Sohan said that the DMRC has not submitted details of rebuilding the bridge. “We will permit the work only after the Salim Rajan flyover is built.” Resolution passed Chairing the function, M.R. Rajendran Nair of the Anti-Corruption People's Movement expressed concern at the Corporation of Cochin not taking the lead in developing alternative roads /bridges/ flyovers in the city through which vehicles can be redirected. The participants passed a resolution condemning the absence of officials from the DMRC, PWD, Railways, and Motor Vehicles' Department at the meeting, despite being invited. Former Additional Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu P.C. Cyriac said that a forum must be formed so that transportation woes in Kochi can be taken up with government agencies.

But expressed concern about the new emerging area even in low-prevalence or medium prevalence states. While in 104 districts more than one per cent prevalence rate was reported at the anti-natal clinic sites across the country, about 14 districts have more than three per cent prevalence rate, she said at an interaction with NGOs here on Saturday. “Though the figure has shown a decline, new hotspots have emerged.

During random checks, some were in for a rude shock on finding premixed alcoholic drinks instead of plain water or fruit juice in water bottles. Mansoor Ali Khan, board member of Delhi Public Group of Schools, said they frequently check water bottles in all their five schools located in Bengaluru and have found at least 16 instances of children carrying alcohol to school in the past two years. “We have found that children carry alcohol to school in their water bottles. It is difficult to detect as it is mixed with juice or water and is transparent,” he said. When they find a student carrying alcohol, they inform the parents and send the children to their in-house counsellor. “We do not want our students to drink alcohol in or outside the school. We involve the parents so that they too can keep a watch,” he said. In a dilemma A teacher, who works in a school in east Bengaluru, was in a dilemma when she found a class nine student had got a bottle of beer to school. “He claimed to have got it just to show it to classmates. I did not know how to deal with the situation. Normally, during graduation day or picnics, we check for alcohol, but now we plan to carry out random checks once a month,” she said. In fact, field trips and excursions are the other areas of concern for school managements. Roshan D'Souza, Principal, Vibgyor High Marathahalli, said they conduct surprise checks for alcohol and electronic gadgets, particularly during field trips. Some schools have decided not to confront students and instead try to educate them about the ill-effects of alcohol. Nooraine Fazal, managing trustee and co-founder of Inventure Academy, has roped in a reformed alcoholic to talk about the harmful effects of alcoholism. Dakshayani Kanna, principal of Harvest International School, believes it would be more effective if students are told to keep away from alcohol by their peers. “About a month ago, students of class eleven and twelve conducted a street play and also included videos that told high school students about why they should stay away from alcohol,” she said. Commenting on consumption of alcohol by those below 21 years, C. R. Chandrashekar, psychiatrist, said there is a need for parents to set an example by not drinking in front of their children. “Children are exposed to scenarios of actors consuming alcohol and they see their parents drinking in social gatherings, and pick it up from there. Also, adolescents are influenced by peer pressure and start experimenting,” he said.

So how do our pet dogs often develop fussy eating habits? Some puppies are clever to train their humans to feed them something tastier by rejecting their regular meals. For such dogs, introduce a little bit of variety by adding a different ingredient every day, like adding buttermilk in her kibble for example. Certain dogs do not eat if a particular family member is away. In that case, teach your dog to be independent. Involve many people in that dog’s life to make up for that one person’s absence. If your dog is rejecting food and also shows signs of stress, then identify the stressor and help her to cope with the situation. Often sedentary lifestyle, absence of quality time with family members, intimidation, harsh punishments or even constant arguments within the family can cause stress in a dog and can affect her appetite. Before making any diagnosis, please check with your vet and make sure your dog does not have any medical issues. Also, at any point in time, if you are not able to zero in on a reason, please seek help with a professional behaviourist who can assess your dog and provide an appropriate solution.",0

Research into neighbourhoods and health had in the past focused on negative impacts through factors like fast-food restaurant density, violence, noise, traffic, poor air quality, vandalism and drug use, said the study authors. For the latest research, the University of Michigan team used data from 5,276 people over 50 with no history of heart problems, who were participants in an ongoing Health and Retirement Study in the United States.They monitored the cardiovascular health of the group, aged 70 on average and mainly married women, for four years from 2006 -- during which 148 of the participants had a heart attack. At the start of the project, the respondents were asked to award points out of seven to reflect how much they felt part of their neighbourhood, could rely on their neighbours in a pinch, could trust their neighbours, and found their neighbours to be friendly. When they crunched the numbers at the end of the study, the team found that for every point they had awarded out of seven, an individual had a reduced heart attack risk over the four-year study period. People who gave a full score of seven out of seven had a 67 percent reduced heart attack risk compared to people who gave a score of one. , study co-author Eric Kim said, describing the difference as “significant.” -AFP",0

Doing what he is best at- luring customers with the onyx artefacts, salt lamps, melamine and micro wave friendly dinner sets, traditional jootis and spice powders to enrich the culinary prowess of Indian gourmet cooks, he is loving every bit of it. Mohammed Iqbal from Karachi flashes a familiar smile at people passing by his stall put up at Swaraj Maidan as part of the on-going 32nd All India Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition. The annual event that attracts traders and artisans from across the country has, this time around, brought a Pathan from across the Indian border. Iqbal's stall is one of the star attractions of the exhibition. He has visited many other cities in India thanks to the Governments of the two countries who threw open the borders. Skilfully crafted Iqbal mainly trades in onyx, which is an expensive stone mined only in Baluchistan, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. He has been in the business for the last 13 years. All the pieces of onyx have been skilfully crafted and manufactured in Karachi. The smooth vases, pedestals and centre tables are machine-made with precision, while the animal forms are meticulously sculpted. The various images created with onyx in his stall include table clocks in the shape of an eagle, fish, a leaf, an umbrella and a heart shape. Animals and birds like elephants, tigers, panthers, frogs, tortoise and beautiful swans and pots and vases have a glossy pearl finish to them. Even the Nandi that Siva rides on has been carved in Karachi and brought here to meet popular demand in the south. The price range of the artefacts begins at Rs. 50 and touches Rs. 2.5 lakh. Each of the two gigantic flowerpots at the entrance weighs nearly four hundred kilograms. The Pakistani offers unique salt herbal lamps with therapeutic qualities. Made of naturally found rock salt, the lamps once lit spread a soothing effect. Besides being ornamental and colourful, their impact helps cleans impurities in human blood. It is particularly recommended for people suffering from stress, depression, blood pressure, fever and asthma. The rays emitted from the lamp leave a soothing impact on the eyes. Sense of humour If the unbreakable crockery is microwave friendly and priced reasonably, the traditional Pakistani masalas can spice up any delicacy. Jahnamaaz or a tiny rug, used to kneel down on while praying, is weaved exquisitely with an image of Makkah on it. Buyers of the rugs get a string of prayer beads free. ""I am the proud father of two sons and a daughter but I have only one wife,"" he chuckles. Though language is a barrier, the strong emotions and the warmth overcomes it all. Refusing to be a pessimist, Iqbal talks of the light at the end of the tunnel. ""What could not be imagined in the past 55 years- bringing people of the two countries closer, seems possible now,"" he says expressing hope. People of both the countries have similar ethnic backgrounds and they can become a force to reckon with if united, he feels. ""Animosity between the two governments notwithstanding, the heart of a common man in Pakistan is full of warmth for his Indian brethren,"" he says emotionally.",0

According to them, the panchayat has chalked out the project on the basis of the government’s Haritha Keralam programme.

However, Ranbaxy has since posted its reaction to the CBS report arguing that, “comments were made about Ranbaxy’s current regulatory situation that [were] misinformed and misleading.” Addressing some of the issues raised, Ranbaxy said that it “recognises and regrets that there may have been certain shortcomings in the past and appropriate measures have been taken to ensure they do not recur.” The company noted that an entirely new management team was in place. Although Ranbaxy pled guilty to seven felony charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in May, and despite its manufacturing plants in Paonta Sahib and Dewas being subject to import restrictions or alerts, even as late as September yet another Ranbaxy facility, in Mohali, was found by the FDA to have made drugs with human hair or rubber particles in tablets and subjected to a similar import alert.",0

A day after an interview by Mr. Bhagwat to The Organiser and Panchajanya in which he said the system needed to be reviewed by an apolitical body, the BJP declared its support for reservation and denied it favoured its reconsideration. ‘No reconsideration’ “The BJP is not in favour of any reconsideration of reservation being extended to these groups: the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes,” Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said at a hastily called press conference. The BJP, he added, “has always supported reservation, we believe reservation is important for uplift.” The statement was preceded by a tweet from BJP general secretary Ram Madhav that the “RSS clarifies that Shri Bhagwatji has not made any comment on the existing reservation system.” It was an acknowledgement that the RSS chief had led the party into the stinging nettles of quota politics.

562,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/parity-in-tdrs-demanded/article3457629.ece,features,propertyplus,Parity in TDRs demanded,"The new building rules announced under GO 168 by the Andhra Pradesh Government have been welcomed because of the relaxation it gave mainly for small sites. However, certain concerns still remain. They were voiced by builders and architects at a meeting held recently by the GVMC with the Director of Town and Country Planning. They relate to Transfer of Development Rights with retrospective effect and also relaxing the penalty clause for 10 per cent violation and the number of housing units in small sites or those abutting small roads. In the new GO, for each square yard given for road-widening, TDR of 18 sft is announced. However, earlier for those who had lost site only 9 sft was given. Since TDRs are transferable, they also should be given the benefit, it is contended. Several city roads were widened and now the focus is on the roads on the suburbs as well. “But either roads already expanded or being widened now are taken up in accordance with Master Plan of 2006 for implementation and hence there should be equal justice,” says Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India, Visakhapatnam Chapter president B. Raja Srinivas. While some had already utilised there are others who still have it with them and implementing it with retrospective effect will benefit such people, he says. Another relaxation sought relates to setbacks. If someone takes up construction in the site where TDRs are given he is given benefit both for setbacks and construction of another floor. But if it is utilised somewhere else, only additional floor is allowed. CREDAI demands that it should be made applicable on both the counts. Another major amendment sought in GO no. 168 is in relation to compounding fee for 10 per cent violation. It had not been made applicable to Visakhapatnam in the earlier GO 678. But after some contention over the same penalty being imposed irrespective of land value in any area, it has been made equivalent to land value. But, says Mr. Srinivas, it is being interpreted as compounding fee on built-up area instead of value of land making it multi-fold. Hence the earlier provision should be restored, realtors contended. CREDAI lauded the government getting back to architects and builders after the GO was issued as a good gesture. Officials received all the objections raised and suggestions made and promised to take them to the notice of the government. Housing units Objections were raised for allowing only four individual units in sites between 200 sq m and 300 sq m instead of the earlier six. Besides one floor for parking, three floors with each two units totalling six would have resulted in creation of more units. But the government wants it to limit it to four mainly with the idea of reducing density. Another contentious issue is in sites abutting 20 ft and 24 feet roads permission only for three floors but with a restriction of four units and leaving the site for 30-feet road. The government says it is better than the earlier provision where no permission is given. But limiting it to only three floors will reduce the area available by 40 per cent. On the top of it, not allowing apartments is irrational, say architects. The whole issue should be viewed, not from the point of violation but from the units it will add to housing, says architect Y. Narasimha Rao. Since the volume has already been reduced in sites abutting small roads, apartments should be allowed, he says.",0

The association's Kozhikode unit has appealed to all who have taken loans to get ready to launch an agitation against the “exorbitant interest rate” and the hefty penal interest on loan defaulters charged by the Board. Association's office-bearers said in a statement here on Wednesday that “hundreds of people are caught in a debt-trap and some were on the brink of suicide as they are unable to repay the outstanding dues after getting revenue recovery notices.” Several representations given to the authorities to take a lenient view on the matter had fallen on deaf ears. The association demanded exemption from penal interest and high interest charged on housing loans, withdrawal of auction of defaulters' houses, write off loans of beneficiaries who have died or are crippled by terminal diseases, and an inquiry into the alleged corruption in the Board's Maithri housing scheme. The association threatened to launch an agitation if the government did not act on its demands immediately. In a press note, KSHB Secretary claimed that the Board had initiated revenue recovery proceedings only in 52 cases in Kozhikode district, that too after confirming the defaulters had sufficient assets to clear the arrears. “The action is only against those defaulters who have taken the loans between 1989 and 2000 and had cared to repay only a few instalments. They had also failed to avail themselves of the facility that was offered for one-time settlement of arrears,” the Secretary said. Of the 52 persons issued revenue recovery notices, 13 settled their dues, and of the remaining, a majority had expressed willingness to clear their arrears either in one go or in instalments. The Secretary alleged that only a handful of people were behind the move to launch an agitation.",0

HARMAAN R A J MADON gets behind the wheel When a business house like Tata, with a diverse portfolio goes on to make the automobile its core business, it has its sights on success. Yes, the Indica platform has been utilised effectively, spawning variations from hatchback to estate, but the other side of the story is Tata's success with diesel power. The latest step ahead is the provision of a common rail DiCOR engine in the Indigo sedan. And we find out how good it really is. Inside out Given the price premium and the positioning above the regular TCIC (turbo-charged, intercooled) diesel Indigo, Tata needed to spruce up the car. And therefore, the exteriors feature redesigned tail lamps, while the front of the car is better to look at too, with sharply defined detailing in place. However, it still remains that yawning wheel arches cry out for larger wheels and wider rubber. The interiors boast a leather-wrapped steering wheel and similar gear knob, while backlit, white-faced instruments lend a sporty touch. Overall, the controls feel good to the tactile senses - an improvement over the Tatas of yore. While the door pockets and the lockable glove box offer prodigious room, it is the lack of cubbyholes for odds and ends, which irritates. You have to keep your CDs, loose change and cell phone wherever you can, which is surprising for a car at this price. The Indigo makes up for these niggles with high seating and wide-opening doors, which makes life easier for users, especially older people. But of course, the heart of the matter is the new DiCOR diesel engine, augmented by Delphi's common-rail system, which makes for better performance, better drivability and of course, better fuel economy. Under the hood The engine features a capacity of 1396cc, a drop of 9cc compared to the previous model. Power remains unchanged at 70 bhp but there is a marginal increase in torque to 14.27 kgm. While this might not seem to make for excellent performance, the car is a two full seconds quicker to 100kph and four seconds quicker in the in-gear slogs. This makes overtaking easier, and while not exactly sprightly, the DiCOR makes the Indigo easier to drive now. In comparison, lower down the rev range, the older TCIC engine feels more responsive but after 2,000 rpm, it is the DiCOR powerplant, which has a better grip on affairs.It revs up to 4,850 rpm, but going beyond 4,200 rpm is irrelevant as the power trails off and the engine sounds harsh. Make no mistake, even at idle, this is not necessarily the most refined diesel going - the clatter is unmistakable and even with all the extra sound deadening about, you will not be fooled. At a cruise though, it is reasonably quiet and in-cabin boom is kept to a minimum.The common-rail system developed by Delphi, operates at a pressure of 1,600 bar, and can provide five injections per stroke; but in the Indigo, these are limited to three squirts per stroke. More injections mean a smoother engine. For now, Tata has elected to go with three injections per stroke until the Bharat Stage IV emission norms come in. Fuel economy in this car is par for the course, and it returns an overall figure of 14.27 kpl in the combined city/highway driving cycle. Behind the wheel The rest of the driving experience is pretty similar to what we are used to. Body roll is pronounced and the steering feels vague around the straight-ahead position. A car for the enthusiast this isn't, but for everyday driving, it doesn't disappoint too much. In town, the light steering and long travel suspension are a boon.The DiCOR's brakes have good bite and stop the car reasonably quickly but lack feel and modulation. Panic stops in slippery conditions can get hairy in this car. The gearbox is the same and the cable-operated gearshift is as rubbery as ever. Overall, what the Indigo DiCOR achieves is to showcase Tata's steady commitment to improving the Indica platform and offer better cars as the days go by, and the Indigo DiCOR is the next logical step to the all-new Indica/Indigo platform which we can look forward to in a while from now. However, at a half-lakh-rupee premium over the TCIC Indigo, it is not necessarily all that much more car for your money.",0

A Division Bench, comprising Justices C. Nagappan and M. Sathyanarayanan, passed the interim order on petitions by Perarivalan, Santhan and Murugan. As the matter involved the consideration of a question of law, the petitions were being admitted and there would be an interim injunction, the Bench said. Additional Solicitor-General M. Ravindran and Advocate-General A. Navaneethakrishnan took notice for the Central and State governments. The Bench said the counter should be filed in eight weeks. As soon as the order was dictated in the court hall, there were joyous shouts inside and outside. Slogans were raised on the court premises. Crackers were burst in front of the court. The petitioners' main contention was that the delay in disposal of the mercy petitions by 11 years and four months made the execution of the death sentence “unduly harsh and excessive,” amounting to violation of their right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. The sentence of death after 20 years of incarceration was “unjust and inhuman.” The High Court's — and, eventually, Supreme Court's — ruling on the present matter will have implications for other high profile convicts on death row, including Afzal Guru and Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, who have cited the lengthy delay in the disposal of their own mercy petitions as grounds for clemency. Santhan and Murugan submitted that the jurisprudence in this issue was clearly developed by the Supreme Court. The consistent position was that if the delay was shown to be excessive and unjustified in the facts of the case, execution of the death sentence would amount to harsh and inhuman punishment violative of Article 21. The court should commute the death sentence. Senior advocates Ram Jethmalani, R. Vaigai and Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the prisoners, argued that the long delay rendered the death penalty illegal and unconstitutional. MDMK general secretary Vaiko, Perarivalan's mother Arputhammal and film director and leader of the Naam Tamizhar Iyakkam Seeman were among those present in the court hall. There was jubilation on the court premises after the order. Members of various organisations raised slogans demanding the abolition of the death penalty. Fighting back tears, Arputhammal said the three were innocent. They should be allowed to live.

What is a PR card? The PR card, issued under Urban Property Ownership Records Project (UPORP), is a document that contains information on the location, measurement, boundaries, transactions, built-up area, ownership rights, tax paid and past encumbrances related to the property. It has been made mandatory to furnish these cards for the sale of property within the city limits. It may be mentioned here that the department had recently asked property owners within Shivamogga city limits to submit the necessary documents and applications within 30 days to avail their PR cards. Government-owned property Munish Moudgil, Commissioner with the Department, has said that those properties for which ownership documents were not furnished with PR card applications within the stipulated time, would be termed properties without necessary ownership records under section 67 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1954 and the government would be declared the owner of these properties. This decision has evoked strong criticism from the public. K.M. Ashok Yadav, of Anna Hazare Horata Samiti, said that the decision created a lot of apprehension among the people. Of the 93,000 properties in city limits, the documents needed for PR cards have been furnished only for 55,000 properties so far. The owners of properties located in old residential areas, including Kote Road and Gandhi Bazaar, do not have records to claim ownership over the property they possess. There are complaints of inordinate delay in issuance of PR cards owing to the menace of middlemen and technical glitches at the department. Prior to setting a deadline to avail PR cards, the department should have held consultations with the people to listen to their grievances over UPORP, Mr. Moudgil said. Meeting held Meanwhile, a delegation of leaders from the Congress have met Revenue Minister V. Srinivas Prasad during his visit to the city recently, and requested him to direct the department to withdraw the order. The chairperson of Shivamogga Urban Development Authority N. Ramesh, who was part of the delegation, has said that most city residents are ignorant of the process of availing PR cards. It is necessary to create awareness among the people about the issue.

The programme is targeted at veterinarians working in conflict-prone areas and places with good forest cover such as Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Erode, Tirupur, Dindigul, Theni, Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts. On Tuesday, sessions were held on the roles of veterinarians in wildlife management, capturing and translocating animals, the status of wildlife conservation in Tamil Nadu, an overview of man-animal conflicts in the region as well as ecology of wild animals and identification of wild animals using indirect evidence. Forest veterinarian N.S. Manoharan shared his experience of capturing and translocating wild tuskers and other animals. “The role of veterinarians in conservation and mitigating man-animal conflicts has definitely increased. Our roles also extend to disease prevention and prophylactic treatment of captive animals such as elephants,” he said. The programme is set to continue on Wednesday as well.",0

Ms. Kulkarni, who was present at the protest, said,“One day the management summoned me and told me that my services were not required anymore.

Every year, after the last working day on April 30, I rejoin from mid-June. This year, I was told to join from August when the new batch begins. On asking who would take classes for Class XII students, I was told that it will be taken care of.” Ms. Singh added, “I and two of my colleagues were told that teachers would be interviewed every year to decide if the management wanted to continue with them or not. If I had a hint of this, I would have looked for other options. Now I am facing unemployment.” ‘Unfair and baseless’ Shriprakash Dixit, vice-president of the union said, “We stand by the teachers.

Among the latest such requests is a call for a small bus service between Chromepet and Nemilichery (not to be confused with the Nemilichery that is around 30 kilometres away and through which the Outer Ring Road courses). The Nemilichary in question is around 4 kilometres from Chromepet and introduction of a small bus between these localities would benefit residents of Jain Nagar, Maruthi Nagar, A.K. Nagar and A.G.S. Colony, Hasthinapuram. In fact, the request for the service has come from these residents. K. Kumar, a resident of AGS Colony, says, “There are no direct bus services between Nemilichery and Chromepet. Even share autorickshaws don’t ply between these localities. Residents either rely on private transport or walk up to the Hasthinapuram bus terminus to reach Chromepet. If small buses are introduced, covering these areas, it would be of immense help to commuters, especially senior citizens.” AGS Colony, off Rajendra Prasad Road, is a thickly-populated residential area and is proximate to Chitlapakkam and Chromepet. Most of the residents belong to the middle-income group and spending on autorickshaws on a daily basis will eat considerably into their budgets. “Commuting by MTC buses to Hasthinapuram from Chromepet and other areas is an ordeal. The frequency of the services 66A (Hasthinapuram to Kundrathur), M52 (Hasthinapuram to Pozhichalur), M18G (Hasthinapuram to Guduvanchery), 52B (Hasthinapuram to Broadway) and 500A (Hasthinapuram to Chengalpet) should be increased, and new services should be introduced,” commuters point out. “Also, several representations to the MTC officials to introduce direct buses to north Chennai and various parts of south Chennai from the Hasthinapuram bus terminus have gone in vain. Buses to Anna Square, Poonamalle, Avadi, Thiruvanmiyur, Adyar and Ambattur should be introduced from the terminus. Now, we have to go to Chromepet to take a bus for north Chennai.” Commuters also complain about the lack of basic civic amenities at the terminus. “The bus terminus does not have proper toilets, clean drinking water, spacious shelters and an adequate seating arrangement,” K Rajendran, one of the commuters, says.

With the issuing of the notification, the plastic ban has been technically in force since Friday — making even the sale of common use items such as plastic forks, spoons, cups and plates illegal. Traders who talked to The Hindu said the enforcement should not begin until their stocks, bought over the past few months, are exhausted. “Unfortunately, with the notification, it is becoming difficult to sell the plastic products … the raids by civic authorities began even as the draft notification was made public,” said a trader. However, the “strict” enforcement of the rule is expected to commence from Monday. “We will start doing random checks on traders and industries from Monday itself. Since the ban is in force, there is no leniency — because plastic manufacturers have known about the rules over the past few months,” said Lakshman, Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. Similarly, Anil Kumar T.K., Secretary (Urban Development and Municipal Administration), said as officials across the State had been trained to crack down on plastic lesser than 40 microns thickness, it should “not be difficult” to enforce a broader ban. “As soon as the notification is studied, instructions will be passed on to all urban local bodies.” Shopkeepers happy The ban is in principle supported by shop-keepers. For instance, at the busy Russel Market, where thousands are given plastic bags for vegetables, dry fruits and meats, the local association — which represents more than 480 shops in the iconic complex — has started the process of doing away with plastics in the complex. “This is the right time to impose the ban. We have told the traders to do away with plastics to reduce the piling garbage close to our market. Now, with the ban, we will ensure all shopkeepers use cloth or paper bags within a fortnight,” said Mohammad Idres, general secretary of the Russel Market Traders’ Association. Similarly, traders at K.R. Market, where 1,300 shops see vendors giving out more than 200 kg of plastic bags daily, believe penalties can ensure strict implementation of the ban. Plastic assn. to move court Suresh Sagar, honorary secretary of the Karnataka State Plastic Association, has said there was no option but to go to the court. “The draft plastic rules of the Central Government proposes to ban plastic bags of 50 micron thickness or lesser. Why can’t the State government follow this instead of a blanket ban?” he said, adding that the expectation of reductions in solid waste was “unrealistic”. He believed more than 350 plastic industries would be directly affected — particularly those manufacturing plastic bags and cling wraps. A majority of these are small-scale industries.",0

600,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/a-tale-of-two-tiger-reserves/article3272075.ece,in-school,None,A tale of two tiger reserves,"First there was the Sariska debacle in which all the tigers were found missing in the reserve in Rajasthan's Alwar district sometime in 2004-05. Then there was similar misfortune in Madhya Pradesh's Panna Tiger Reserve in February 2009 — the wild cats became extinct there. Sariska led the way soon by reintroducing tigers under a recovery plan with the support of the National Tiger Conservation Authority in June 2008. Panna followed suit in March 2009. It reintroduced one female each from Bhandavgarh and Kanha. Thereafter, it appears, both the reserves charted their own journeys. The Panna experiment turned out to be a big success. The 576-sq.km reserve, spread over Panna and Chattarpur districts of Madhya Pradesh, soon became home to a flourishing population of big cats. The reserve, 25km from Khajuraho, once ravaged by problems, has now 12 tiger cubs, besides the five adults brought in as part of the reintroduction. And that gives Sariska, the leader, a complex, for its three tigresses are yet to give a litter. The tale of the two reserves came in for comparison this weekend at Alwar when the main protagonists of the tiger reintroduction process got together to discuss the rebuilding of Sariska. “Where there is a will there is a way,” said R Sreenivasa Murthy, Field Director in the Panna Tiger Reserve, giving a presentation on tiger relocation and their successful breeding. The Panna story included the truancy of the lone male, which apparently showed “homing” instincts to repeatedly move in the direction of Pench — it had to be brought back with the help of 70-strong forest staff and four elephants for a second time. The Panna experiment did not stop at just reintroduction. The park authorities opened a new chapter in conservation by introducing two orphaned female cubs to the reserve in March 2011. They were the litters of a collared tigress that got killed in a fight with another in Kanha in May 2005. They were picked up and hand-reared for one-and-half years to be released into an enclosure in Kanha. “The Panna team met with success in the rewilding of the tiger. One of them, T4, delivered cubs in November 2011,” said Mr. Murthy. Mr. Murthy and H.S. Pabla, who retired last year as the Chief Wildlife Warden of Madhya Pradesh, said they did their part and left the rest to the tigers. “In Sariska, females ST2 and ST3, showed signs of pregnancy but no litters were produced. The cause of not breeding is not known,” said K. Sankar, scientist with the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehra Dun, who has been part of the Sariska experiment. “There appears to be no disturbance to the tigers. The prey density is one of the best in the country. However, the human habitation inside the park surely is an obstacle. In fact, the Sariska tigers have only 50 sq.km in the 882-sq.km reserve for themselves.” While some experts, including Sunayan Sharma, president of the Sariska Tiger Foundation, which organised the workshop, felt that the radio collars around their necks might be hampering the breeding, others emphatically dismissed it as inconsequential. “There is no connection between the radio collar and breeding,” said Dr. Sankar. “We have consulted the NTCA and they are of the opinion that collars cannot be the reason,” said U.M. Sahai, Head of the Forest Force, Rajasthan. What made all the difference in Panna? “I have no explanation why tigers are not breeding in Sariska and they do in Panna,” said Mr. Pabla. His suggestion to the Rajasthan authorities in this connection included introduction of breeding tigresses — instead of virgins — and not to have too many males around. Mr. Murthy said the presence of elephants in Panna was of great help to tigers. Moreover, Panna had an advantage of not having any village inside. Raghuveer Singh Shekhawat, Field Director, Sariska Tiger Reserve, is confident of a breakthrough in the reserve. “What is all this fuss about litters? We need to leave certain [things] for the tigers to decide,” said Samir Sinha, author and head of TRAFFIC India.",0

Prabhu (29) started the business a year ago and gets 100 to 150 customers a day even during rainy season. In summer, the number goes up. He now plans to expand “Amma Ilaneer” to more places in the city and is looking for space. “I am a computer science graduate and I was into other businesses. I started selling tender coconut a year ago. I have been able to sell at Rs. 15 each by reducing the profit. Now, many other vendors have also reduced the price,” he says. Tender coconut is not sold at the farm fresh consumer outlets run in the district to sell vegetables at prices lower than the market price. Minister S.P. Velumani, who is also the Coimbatore Rural District Secretary of the party, says Prabhu’s family members have been supporters of AIADMK for a long time. “We will support any gesture that benefits the public and brings good name to the Chief Minister and the Government,” he adds.",0

Though the actors think that it is a high point in their careers, it has nothing new to offer in terms of story and performances. First, there will be a background that throws light on the heroine’s pathetic state and the reasons that led her into taking up the profession, then comes a man in her life and the big twist that leads to her denouement. Prema Oka Maikam refers to the intoxication of love that makes the girl kill herself to absolve herself from guilt and the zilch future she sees for herself at a juncture in her life. Mallika lives in a huge house, there is no one at home that she can call her own but she flaunts a few friendships, all of them men, and revels in talking to them on the phone. In a sozzled state she drives recklessly and bumps into a young man who loses his sight. Now that this young man is a writer, a poet and has a girlfriend is a different story that comes in a flashback. Meanwhile, Mallika unable to take the emptiness in her life and the lack of respect from men does the unthinkable, kills herself but not before pledging her eyes to this young man. She also gives away her wealth to the man and arranges his marriage with his lady love. Some stories are good to read but look quite heavy on screen. Melodrama is okay but only if it is executed well. Not only has the story been shot shoddily, it looks worse than a documentary. The little known actors add to the misery. This generation relates to stories only if it is realistic, a woman who shows no feelings when she learns she caused an accident that led to a man’s blindness gives her life just to replace them. It is irresponsible acting from Charmme and there is nonchalance in dialogues. “The man lost his eyes” is the statement by the doctor played by Rao Ramesh. A simple “ Auna ?” is Charmme response, and the most numbing dialogue to come next is “Don’t worry, eyes pothe Chiranjeevi blood bank undhi ga ?” Was that meant to please Chiranjeevi or does the filmmaker mean for every blind man, there is a replacement waiting at the eye bank, even if the intention is good it was spoken in an uncharitable manner. Wonder if that is the case why Mallika had to kill herself to give her eyes to the victim.Rao Ramesh’s choice of playing a doctor with two shades was condescending, even while discussing the therapy with the sex worker he makes a pass at her. The entire film shows men as having a weakness for woman except the hero who lavishes praise on Mallika and womanhood. The outdated film has a regressive and clichéd scene, of the heroine undressing in front of the blind man and asking him what he thinks of her and attraction. Background score is terrible and jarring on the ears, cinematography is poor. We know love is blind but not this silly and bookish. y. sunita chowdhary PREMA OKA MAIKAM Cast:Charmme Kaur, Rahul Direction:Chandu Music:MGK Praveen Genre:Love Plot:A call girl atones for her sin Bottomline:Outdated and amateurish",0

The airstrikes late Saturday in the Tirrah valley of the Khyber region destroyed four militant hideouts and a suicide bomber training centre, the army said in a statement. The military says the operation in Khyber — in which 1,200 militants have been killed — is aimed at militants who have fled a massive offensive in the neighbouring North Waziristan region that was launched last June. Last month’s school massacre in Peshawar — in which over 140 people were killed, mainly children — is believed to have been launched from Khyber. The attack prompted both Afghanistan and Pakistan to vow tougher action along the porous border. — AP",1

The economic blockade imposed by the UNC, an umbrella body of Naga groups under the patronage of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), against the Manipur government’s decision to carve out seven new districts, has continued for over four months now. The UNC sees the move as an attempt to truncate the concept of a greater Nagalim. The Centre has been accused of turning a blind eye to the activities of the UNC, with which the Union government had signed a framework agreement in 2015 to resolve the decades-old Naga issue. “We will soon send a notice for holding talks with UNC and the Manipur government. Let’s see, if they respond to the notice. Last time, on 15th November, 2016, when such meeting was held, no representative of the Manipur government showed up,” said a senior government official. The official added that the meeting has been proposed to be held in Delhi on February 5, 2017. Last week, the Centre pressed into service two C-17 Globemaster cargo aircrafts to airlift six fuel tankers to Imphal. An official said that 96 kilolitres of petrol was airlifted to ease the oil shortage in the State. Ending the deadlock The Union government even sought Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi’s opinion to end the economic blockade. After consultation, it concluded that no law permitted Centre to interfere in the matter, as law and order was a State subject. “We have been sending Central forces and are doing our bit. The State government has not been forthcoming to end the deadlock as the current situation would help them in the upcoming elections,” said the official. Manipur is going to the polls on March 4 and 8 and due to the ongoing economic blockade, it has been kept in the most sensitive category, an official said, adding that elections were being held in two phases for the first time in the State.. Around 17,500 Central forces are deployed in Manipur currently and another 50,000 would reach there in March after elections in the other four States are over. The Centre has even kept choppers and aircraft on standby, in case forces need to be airlifted. Home Minister Rajnath Singh had earlier sent a tough message to Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh that if the State government failed in discharging its constitutional duties, the Centre “may have to explore other measures under the provisions of Constitution of India to ensure that the difficulties of the people of Manipur are alleviated.” Home Ministry’s worry The Home Ministry had earlier written a letter to the Election Commission of India (ECI) regarding the “ongoing tension and grave law and order situation” and requested it to defer the elections in the State in wake of shortage of security forces. The EC overruled Home Ministry’s apprehensions and announced that polls will be held in the State in two phases on March 4 and 8.",1

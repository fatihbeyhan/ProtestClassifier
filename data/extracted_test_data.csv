During a period dominated by the legendary Anil Kumble, Bahutule, who was rated highly, always remained on the fringe at his prime. He played two Tests, against Australia and Sri Lanka, and eight ODI for the country taking three and two wickets respectively. His domestic career, spanning 20 years, was more prolific. He captured 630 first class wickets with 27 five-wicket hauls and scored over 6,000 runs, including nine centuries. Announcing his retirement, Bahutule said leading Mumbai to a Ranji Trophy title win in 2008 would remain one of the high points of his career. “I have no regrets. I played well in every season.

But the dance of death on the roads of Cyberabad Commissionerate goes on unabated. The alarming figures of 863 deaths in 2005 and 1,020 deaths in 2006 in road accidents took a frightening turn with 1,050 lives already lost by the end of November. Fatal accident rate Interestingly, the fatal accident rate in the city could be contained - it in fact came down from 418 in 2004 to 344 deaths in 2005. But, the accident figures on the city’s outskirts present a pessimistic picture. The question is when the Hyderabad police could check, if not bring down, loss of lives in road accidents, why cannot their counterparts in Cyberabad? Many factors From the high average speed of vehicles to presence of heavy vehicles to inadequate lighting on the roads to poor condition of roads, there are many factors that contribute to the scaring accident figures. For example, 395 pedestrians died in Cyberabad till now this year. Ironically, there are more foot overbridges (FOBs) in central parts of the city than on its fringe areas. “Forget about FOBs, even road marking or signage is not properly done on the thoroughfares in Cyberabad. Efforts to alert people about pedestrian deaths are nil,” the people say. Traffic menace Light poles are being erected on some main roads ‘now’. Many busy intersections have no traffic signal light facilities. For want of strength, the traffic police are not able to post men at a large number of junctions. Heavy vehicles are a big traffic menace and are responsible for killing more people than any other category of vehicles. Nearly one third of road accident deaths occurred on internal roads. No manpower Lack of manpower to regulate vehicles on these stretches is the reason, the police say. Instead of knee-jerk reactions, a comprehensive strategy coupled with better facilities and awareness campaign among commuters would bring down the accidents, traffic experts opine.",0

But the project still remains on paper. As early as in April, the district panchayat unveiled its plan to revive the lake after the Department of Environment and Climate Change agreed to disburse financial assistance to the tune of Rs. 49.4 lakh for the restoration work. The revival plan, as recommended by the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management, was discussed at a meeting of representatives of various government departments, panchayats and non-governmental organisations on April 25. The meeting had set a deadline of two weeks for the departments to prepare an action plan and to conduct a survey to demarcate the lake’s boundary. The delay in particularly starting the survey had not gone down well with the representatives of the district panchayat. Vice-president of the panchayat, Rufus Daniel told The Hindu that the best time to demarcate the lake was during monsoon time when the lake was filled with water. Encroachment “If the Department of Survey and Land Records could have commenced the work to identify the boundary line of the lake sometime in June we could have started bio-fencing work by now. The delay was because a powerful lobby was working against the renovation work as proper demarcation would bring to light the encroachment,” Mr. Rufus said. The panchayat had even suggested to the Department to seek the services of retired staff to carry out the survey if shortage of manpower was the reason for the delay, he said. The panchayat committee would be convened within two weeks to discuss the future course of action, he added. However, District Collector K. N Satheesh, refuted the charge and said the delay was purely due to administrative reasons. The Department of Survey and Land Records was currently involved in Project Zero Landless and the four- laning of the Karamana-Kaliyikkavila stretch of the National Highway-66 passing through the capital, he said. The work to demarcate the lake’s boundary would be undertaken in October and the project would be completed in a time-bound manner, he added.",0

Interacting with the mediapersons on Wednesday after reviewing the arrangements at the TVoA desk which became operational on August 15 at the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, the Chief Minister, Oommen Chandy, said it was a matter of ‘pride’ for Kerala that it had become the only State in the country to have two airports with TVoA facilities. “It is a good beginning and the State will exploit the situation to increase the foreign tourist arrivals by taking adequate steps to market it,” Mr. Chandy said. Earlier, the Chief Minister interacted with the Airport Director, V. N. Chandran, Foreigners Regional Registration Officer, K. K. Jaymohan, and Intelligence Bureau officials manning the T-VoA desk to get a know-how of the facility being offered to holiday makers and got himself photographed for the visa.

Citizens of Finland, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, Myanmar and Indonesia can get TVoA on landing at these two airports. So far, eight persons have availed the facility in the two airports. Kaitharath Binoy Paul from New Zealand who arrived in Tiger Airways flight on August 17 was the first to avail the TVoA in the premier international airport. Minister for Tourism, A. P.

Mr. Anil Kumar said these countries are markets where Kerala Tourism sees vast potential and is beginning to make significant inroads. The tourist arrivals from Japan rose by around 56 per cent in five years to 11,440 in 2012 and the arrivals from Finland more than doubled over the period to 5,160 last year. Tourist arrivals from countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and the Philippines have similarly risen between 75 per cent and 90 per cent since 2008. “We will take part in travel fairs and take our road shows to tell people there how convenient visiting Kerala is,” the Minister said. Kerala Tourism will take part for the first time in the JATA Travel Showcase 2013 in Tokyo from September 12-15.

The first phase of land acquisition for the project, where 1800-acres of land were acquired, went off smoothly. The trouble started when 2035 acres were notified for acquisition in the second phase in May 2007. This was when the Samyukta Hitarakshana Samiti, spearheaded by Bhujanga Shetty, was upstaged by Krishi Bhoomi Samrakshana Samiti, led by Madhukar Ameen, in June 2007, as an organisation that represented farmers who were going to be displaced by the project. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, led by Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, also jumped into the fray. The efforts of the farmers were strengthened by environmental groups in the city. More than four thousand people turned up to voice their dissent during the November 28-public hearing on the environmental impact of the project. They trashed the earlier claims of the promoters of the project that only a few errant individuals were trying to sabotage the SEZ. The launch of Mangalore-Yeshwanthpur Express train on December 8 came as a big relief to people who had borne the brunt of bad roads. Volvo buses, which earn Rs. 35-lakh a week for Mangalore division of KSRTC, dominated the road transport. Although the division registered better growth and was looking for more revenue, the introduction of the train to Bangalore has hit it and the private transportershard. Fishermen’s demands for dredging in the waters closer to the coast hardly got attention of the authorities. They had a poor season in October and November. Many fishermen did not venture into the sea fearing loss. Cuttlefish, an export species, eluded them. They were, however, happy that encroachment of fishing territory got good attention, with Goa and Karnataka Government announcing fishing holidays for the same period, unlike in the past. Two merchant vessels, Den Den and Cheng Le Men bore the brunt of rough Arabian Sea at the height of monsoon. Three sailors from Den Den lost their lives, off the Tannirbhavi coast. The authorities concerned had to maintain a constant vigil against pollution from Den Den, which ran aground, close to the coast. Sailors on board Cheng Le Men were lucky that prompt salvage operations and favourable weather conditions did not see this beached vessel go the Den Den way. Major power wrangling between the ruling combine and opposition Congress resulted in various rural development activities take a hit in the process. As many as 49 gram panchayats receiving the Nirmal Gram Puraskar from the then President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a feather in the cap for the zilla panchayat.

The lid of discipline imposed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) got blown off after a number of candidates who improved their tally from the previous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections began accusing the leadership of neglecting certain segments, favouring others, and disproportionately sharing the resources provided by the national leadership for running the campaign in the State. Party sources said the national leadership had been hoping to consolidate the position in the State through the formation of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and was expecting to win 10 seats and increase the vote share to 20 per cent. A final review put the number of seats at six. To attain this goal, the leadership had provided resources and designated an array of Union Ministers to add verve to the campaign. The national leadership is reported to be dissatisfied over the mismatch between the target and the outcome. Candidates who have suffered defeat are understood to have apprised the leadership of lapses in ensuring support and aired the view that homogeneity in providing resources would have helped to improve their chances. Though the NDA and the party conducted a post-poll review and expressed satisfaction at the performance, those suffered a defeat are in no mood to relent. The issue would be taken up at the appropriate forum soon, sources said. Party refutes charge But party spokesperson J.R. Padma Kumar chose to dismiss such allegations as mere sham and said the campaign plan, including distribution of funds, was set by a group of leaders at the State-level and there was no disparity in it. Certain segments got more attention considering the importance of the candidates and their winning prospects. Some of them might have garnered more funds at their own initiative too. VIP visits and other such events might have prompted to spend more in certain places. The State leadership had not received any such complaints so far, he said. Candidates feel resources given by national leadership were distributed disproportionately",0

MADURAI: The Madras High Court Bench here on Tuesday said that Indian Police Service officers could not occupy the post of Director of Prosecution. A Division Bench of Justices D. Murugesan and S. Nagamuthu pointed out that as per Section 25A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, only a person holding a law degree and practising as a lawyer for 10 years could be appointed to the post. Contesting a public interest litigation petition on the issue, Additional Advocate-General M. Chellammal submitted that the State had passed a Bill to amend Section 25A, thereby permitting IPS officers to hold the post and sent it for the President’s assent. The judges said that the Bill could not be cited as a reason to fill the post with IPS officers. It would come into effect only after the President’s assent. Until then, Section 25A of the Cr. P.C. would hold good. No locus standi The judges also said that the incumbent M.K. Jha, an IPS officer, had no locus standi to hold the post as he was neither a lawyer practising for ten years nor a law graduate as required under the Cr.P.C. The AAG said the officer had been appointed to the post temporarily under Section 46 of the Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Services Rules, which permit appointment of All India Service officers in State service. Disagreeing with her, Mr. Justice Murugesan wondered how a rule could override the provisions of an Act. “It is a statutory post, not an administrative post, which you can create according to your whims and fancies.” Later, the judges granted time to the AAG till Friday to verify whether the State government had obtained the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court before filling the post as stipulated under section 25A.",0

French beans, carrots, shallot (small onions) and green chilli are at least 30 to 40 per cent costlier than six months ago, show figures released by Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Keralam (VFPCK). Figures from VFPCK show that French beans was selling at Rs.50 a kg in the retail market on Monday against the rate of Rs.30 a kg six months ago. The price of bananas (nendran) has not been affected over the last six months, staying steady in the Rs.33-40 a kg range since January 2013. Beetroot price has doubled from Rs.20 a kg in January to Rs.40 a kg in the retail market. Ginger, the bulk of which comes from Wayanad and Kodagu, is selling at a record Rs.160 a kg in the retail market. Owing to reduction in plantation acreage in Wayanad, ginger is selling at Rs.150 a kg in the wholesale market in the city. The price of ginger six months ago in Kochi was Rs.50 a kg. An okra or ladies’ finger, selling for Rs.20 a kg in the retail markets in the city has been an exception to the trend. Though VFPCK figures said okra was selling at Rs.24 a kg in the retail market, some markets were offering the produce at a lesser price. Okra supplies from areas such as Satyamangalam and Puliyampatti have been abundant, said N.H. Shameed of Ernakulam Market Stall Owners’ Association. The talk of the town, however, is shallot, the price of which has soared to Rs.72 a kg in the retail market. The produce was selling for Rs.80 a kg in some of the retail centres on Sunday. The retail price of the produce was Rs.38 a kg six months ago. Mr. Shameed said the number of vegetable lorry loads coming to the main market in Ernakulam had shrunk from 20–22 to 14– 5 a day. The supply of vegetables over the last two months has been unreliable, he said. Market sources in Coimbatore, from where vegetable produces from Hosur and Thalavady in Karnataka and from Ootty in Tamil Nadu are routed to Kerala, said extreme dry conditions in vegetable growing areas had forced farmers to abandon some of the cultivable areas. French beans was selling at Rs.60 a kg in the Coimbatore wholesale market. Prices of items such as cabbage (Rs. 30), carrot (Rs. 22) and beetroot (Rs. 16) were also high in the wholesale market in Coimbatore. Dry weather, coupled with strong winds, had destroyed flowering vegetable plants in Tamil Nadu’s Nagercoil from where bulk of the supplies of raw banana, ladies fingers, tomato and brinjal reach south Kerala markets such as Kollam. Market sources said farmers had sustained substantial crop losses because of the weather conditions though the last two days have seen heavy rain with the onset of the monsoon. They said the prices of vegetables such as tomato and brinjal were ruling high, with only raw bananas selling at affordable rates.",0

This year the day falls on February 5, the 700th anniversary of this event. Madhwacharya was born in the village of Pajaka close to Udipi. Ordained under the name of Poornaprajna, he soon mastered what his guru Achutaprekshacharya had to teach him. The guru named him Anandatirtha and encouraged him to independently reassess the prevailing understanding and practices of the other schools of Vedantic thought. He extensively toured India and authored 39 works covering commentaries on Brahma Sutra, the Bhagavata, the Gita, the Upanishads and importantly the Rig Veda. Notable are the Anuvakhyana – a terse commentary on Brahma Sutra and the Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya – a grand overview of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. To his followers Madhwacharya was the third of Vayu’s avatara-traya – after Hanuman and Bheema. His works reflect his wide reading and engagement with several texts and form a complete school of philosophical thought – which came to be called ‘Tattvavada’ or ‘Dvaita’. Asserting the duality of the divine and the soul, he created a framework of philosophical thought as an alternative to Advaita and Vishistadvaita. Monotheism for him was the quintessence of Vedanta - Hari being Sarvottama and Vayu Jeevottama. When Madhwacharya embarked on his mission, the country was already in the grip of the threat faced by external conquests. Explains B.N.K. Sharma, a renowned scholar, “Fatalism had robbed society of its inner strength and weakness pervaded the prevailing socio-economic fabric. Acharya Madhwa strived with his philosophy to awaken in his countrymen a renewed faith in Theism” and “to rouse the people to a sense of dignity of man as a real agent in the world,” words later echoed by Purandaradasa’s ‘Essabekku, iddhu jayasabekku.’ In his system of philosophy, Madhwacharya propounded two orders of reality – the Independent ‘Svatantra’ and the Dependent ‘Paratantra’ – the former being the Supreme Brahman. The duality of the God and atman is the basis of reality and all Vedantic literature is in praise of this Supreme one. He explained that God is the ‘bimba’ or the original source and the rest are ‘pratibimbas’ or reflections. He introduced the concept of ‘Sakshi’, explained by Dr. Sharma as “an instrument of validation with the Atman in his capacity as the self-luminous knowing self.” He also formulated the concept of ‘Viseasa’ – of identity in difference. The Pancha-bheda or Fivefold Differences – explained the differences between ‘Paramatma’, ‘jivatma’ and ‘jada.’ His pre-eminent contribution, which remains relevant even now is to put the responsibility of development and emancipation in the hands of the individual. While differences are inherent between individuals, it is for the individuals to study, understand and finally accept the reality of the universe and the omnipresence of God but only after validating the truth for themselves. This attainment is in direct correlation with one’s own effort. Mukti then is not the disappearance of or from the universe but a state of bliss commensurate with the nature of each individual. This gives scope for souls to evolve and turned on its head the ‘Varna’ concept. For Madhwacharya knowledge without action was an impractical intellectual exercise. He consecrated the Krishna idol which he retrieved from a mound of gopichandana in the temple at Udipi. He left behind a legacy of several maths to continue the propagation of his school of thought and devotion. The Ashta Mathas or the eight maths of Udipi manage and perform the daily pujas at the Krishna temple and to the idol which the acharya had installed. The ‘Paryaya’ system of Krishna worship and temple management, and the ‘Dwandwa’ system of pairing the eight maths into groups of four make for a wonderful study in continuity and management. Acharya Madhwa’s teachings resonate in their wisdom, compassion and call to action – for ultimately the benevolence of God is most in abundance when one strives to attain it in words, thought and action. This year is the 700th anniversary of the Acharya leaving the earth. A celebration has been planned in Udipi to mark the occasion.",0

Music reigned supreme during the 75-year-old ghazal legend’s tryst with Kerala. For days, his fans had been ecstatic about the opportunity to hear the legend singing live. During a whirlwind visit to Thiruvananthapuram, Ghulam Ali received an award, gave a concert to a packed audience, hardly met any media persons but spent time with poet Balachandran Chullikad and shot for a documentary helmed by T.K. Rajeev Kumar. During his performance in the capital city, music erased all barriers – political, linguistic and cultural. The night was still young when Ghulam Ali reached Nishangandhi auditorium in Thiruvananthapuram. As awe turned to applause, he entered the stage with a smile and waved to the music buffs waiting patiently for hours to see and hear him in concert. His listeners had to wait for another hour or more before the legendary singer took the stage to serenade his audience with some select numbers. Prior to the concert, Ghulam Ali had spoken to CPI (M) MLA M.A. Baby and music director M. Jayachandran as part of an interview for a private channel. Baby, founder of Swaralaya, a cultural organisation that had organised the function along with the Government of Kerala, said that Ghulam Ali talked about his relationship with his guru Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and his encounters with titans such as Bhimsen Joshi, Mohammed Rafi and Mehdi Hassan. Ghulam Ali recalled how his father, an ardent fan of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, had named his son ‘Ghulam’ after his favourite musician. “He told us how his father had taken him to Kabul where he met the senior singer and requested him to teach the 14-year-old Ghulam. Although his Guru was reluctant as he was travelling a lot, finally, he agreed and that is how the young boy became the Ustad’s student. But since he was living in Kolkata, he advised Ghulam to learn from his brothers as well,” said Baby. While talking about the difference between ghazals and Hindustani music, he told them although both classical music and ghazals needed aesthetic finesse, there was much more attention to the lyrics and its meaning while singing a ghazal. “He told us that he himself had spent a lot of time with poets to understand the layers of meaning in lyrics and how to bring the right pronunciation and intonation to the lyrics he would be singing. The idea was to convey the meaning of the lyrics and its feel through his rendering,” recalled Baby. He demonstrated this during his concert in the capital city through the number ‘Dil mein ek lehar se uthi hai’ when he captured the aural effects of the waves in his music and sang it for the crowd. Snatches of poetry, conversation and flow of music made it an interactive recital for his listeners. He also sang ‘Chupke Chupke’, one of his most popular numbers that he had sung in B.R. Chopra’s film Nikah , with his son Amir Ali. The next day Ghulam Ali had a momentous meeting with Balachandran on camera. As the poet recited the lines he had written some 30 years ago, Ghulam Ali responded with poetry from the heart and added that the visit to Kerala would remain a cherished memory for him. On the sidelines of a television shoot, Ghulam Ali spoke to The Hindu for a short interview. Edited excerpts. What are the memories you will carry with you when you leave Kerala? I will remember the unabashed love that I received everywhere I went. People here were so warm and welcoming. What is your opinion about present-day ghazal singers in India? Singers such as Hariharan, Talat Aziz…Do you listen to them? Shankar too [Shankar Mahadevan]. They are all like my younger brothers and I share a warm rapport with all of them. Yes, they are all good singers. I have listened to all of them. We all sing the same music. Ideally, I wish I had more time to listen to more singers. It is always important to listen to musicians. How about K.J. Yesudas? Yes, I have heard about him. Although we have not met, we know each other. He had sung ‘Aaye Na Baalam…’ You had talked about your memorable meeting with Mohammed Rafi… That was in 1980 in Mumbai. I was staying at the Taj in Mumbai and in the morning I got a call. Rafi bhai used to talk very softly. So, there was this soft voice saying ‘Hello’. I was sleeping and so I was a little dazed. He said that it was Rafi speaking. I asked him ‘Rafi who?’ He said ‘Mohammed Rafi’ and began speaking in Punjabi. We are both from Punjab, you know. He invited me for breakfast to his house and we spent four hours together. I told him ‘Rafi bhai , the whole world listens to you. And he told me ‘But I listen to you!’ I used to consider him as my elder brother. So you remained in touch? Certainly. He was not a trained classical singer but he was an amazing musician. The difference between light music and film music is that the singer cannot improvise while singing a film song. He must sing what is already there. But in light music and classical music, one can improvise as much as one wants. And there are so many different ways of singing the same composition. Twenty years ago, you had recorded an album with Asha Bhosle… That was ‘Miraz-E-Ghazal’. My son Amir Ali also recorded an album with her, a completely new work.",0

Over 1,000 BJP activists and leaders were taken into preventive custody in and around the city while 16 more were arrested for blocking the road at Gagan Pahad in Rajendranagar. The bandh enforcers also tried to obstruct the convoy of Minister for Rural Development D. Srinivas, but were dispersed by the police. Window panes of eight buses-three in west zone, three at Lagnerhouz, three more in West zone and one each at Saifabad and Kukatpally were broken. Tyres of some buses were deflated at Bollaram and Trimulgherry. The bandh was complete in some localities like Dilsukhnagar, Alwal, Gowlipura, partial in areas like Tarnaka and had no impact in other parts. Public transport was affected with the BJP leaders and workers preventing buses from being taken out from RTC depots in the early hours. As a precautionary measure, RTC officials suspended services in some routes till noon, but gradually increased them by evening. People had to depend on personal vehicles for transportation. Bandh enforcers, however, did not obstruct movement of private vehicles. Schools closed Several schools declared holiday voluntarily postponing the scheduled exams. Theatres and petrol bunks were open. BJP leader N. Indrasena Reddy, along with some women activists, was taken into custody while trying to obstruct buses at Dilsukhnagar depot. Legislator G. Kishan Reddy and others were picked up while staging a demonstration in front of the Assembly. BJP State president B. Dattatreya and some party workers were also arrested while trying to lay a siege to the Secretariat. Mr. Dattatreya told reporters on Friday that the ‘success’ of the Telangana bandh had reflected the people’s spontaneous response. The bandh had become the talking point and not the visit of AICC president Sonia Gandhi, he said, protesting against which and also the Congress’ stand on Telangana, the party had given the call for bandh, he told a press conference. Arrests criticised He charged the government with doing its best to foil the bandh and arresting thousands of the party activists across Telangana. He alleged that police had turned Shamshabad and Devadula villages into virtual fortresses. Mr. Dattatreya pointed out that after seeing the success of the bandh, at least now the Congress party and Ms. Gandhi should open their eyes. The party, he stated, would take the Telangana issue forward and force the government to bifurcate the State. Through the success of the bandh, it had sent a clear message through the people that the Congress had betrayed the cause of Telangana. He said the party’s office-bearers and presidents and in-charges of Telangana districts would meet here on Saturday to review the success of the bandh and chalk out future course of action.",1

With the newly renovated Inclusive Education (IED) resource centre equipped with the latest facilities, the daily two-hour sessions that will focus on these students are expected to make a lot of difference. The Rs.5 lakh project implemented under a Ministry of Human Resource Development scheme was inaugurated by Minister for Education P.K. Abdu Rabb on Friday. An amount of Rs.1 lakh has been used to purchase learning materials, including Braille kits, Braille typewriter type writing machines and other aids for visually challenged students. The centre is equipped with adaptive teaching aids and other learning materials. A computer centre, a television, and a home theatre have also been provided to enable interactive learning. Indoor training is very important for children suffering from autism and other intellectual disorders. So, it is important to provide a supportive environment for such training that could create visible changes in the way they spend time at the centre. The adaptive learning aids will be useful not only for children with special needs, but also young children who are interested in coming to the centre, S. Suja, one of the resource teachers at the school, said. Apart from this, the centre will be equipped with a speech therapy unit for which funds have been allotted. The appointment of a speech therapist has been sanctioned. Students from other schools could also avail themselves of this facility, IED director R. Rajan told The Hindu . The school caters to the needs of the special children with the help of three resource teachers. Remedial classes for these children are conducted after school. This academic year, the school has started a new initiative to provide further assistance to the special children. As it is not often possible for the resource teachers to sit through the students' class sessions and the class teachers could only allot a limited time to each of them, manual teaching materials will be given to the teachers to make the teaching task easier, S.L. Sreelatha, the resource teacher at the school, said. This centre will act as the nodal unit for the other IED centres in the city. Plans are on the anvil to set up a vocational and occupational therapy unit for higher secondary students who had passed out of the school, Mr. Rajan said.",0
38,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dalits-enter-temple-amid-tension/article3033476.ece,national,otherstates,Dalits enter temple amid tension,"Mohammed Iqbal SULIA (RAJASTHAN): Peaceful entry of hundreds of Dalits into the ancient Chawanda Mata temple here on Tuesday could not hide complicity of the Administration and the police with the dominant Gujjar caste in persecution of Dalit families through insinuations, slapping of false charges and denial of equal rights. Gujjars of the village, situated 260 km from Jaipur, stayed away from the Dalit Adivasi Adhikar Sammelan organised on the temple premises and virtually boycotted the Dalits' entry into the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. Policemen were deployed in large numbers in the temple premises. Though the presence of a large number of civil rights activists, including Magsaysay Award winner Aruna Roy, and media persons from Jaipur gave confidence to the local Dalits to defy restrictions imposed by the Gujjars, tension in the atmosphere was palpable with a question mark raised over the stance of the Gujjars and higher castes on the issue. The insinuation that Dalits were demanding a share in the 26-bigha agricultural land of the temple and offerings made to the deity was a deliberate ploy to shift attention from assertion of rights by Dalits to enter the temple and offer prayers as equal members of the Hindu community. ""We do not want a single inch of the land or a single paisa from the offerings. Ours is a struggle for self-respect,'' said Bhanwar Meghwanshi, the young convenor of Dalit Adivasi Adhikar Abhiyan. He pointed out that Gujjar and Dalit priests had been worshipping Goddess Chawanda in the temple as a tradition, which was abruptly stopped for no reason other than hatred for Dalits. The Gujjar priest, Mewa Ram, accompanied by youngsters from his community allegedly thrashed the 80-year-old Dalit priest Hazari Balai during the Navratra festivities on October 1 and declared a ban on the entry of Dalits into the temple. The police registered an FIR after nine days following a great deal of persuasion, but have not arrested any of the 12 accused. The Dalits' zeal to get justice could not be defeated by ploys such as registration of false cases against them alleging attempts to steal the offerings and clothes draped on the idol and violating peace. The Administration then tried to evolve a compromise without giving Dalits the right to enter the sanctum sanctorum. State Rural Development Minister Kalulal Gujjar, who is an MLA from neighbouring Mandal in Bhilwara district, was the target of attack at the public meeting attended by about 2,000 Dalits after entry into the temple. Mr. Gujjar brought members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's Scheduled Caste Morcha from other villages to Sulia on November 26 and ""staged a drama'' of taking them inside the temple.",1

The employees also served an ultimatum to the government that unless they shelved the decision on privatisation, they would go ahead with their indefinite strike plan and intensify their ongoing agitation. As hundreds of employees from the city went to Vizianagaram to take part in the last rites of N. Venkatesh, 28, an assistant in the administration department of the corporation, who committed suicide on railway tracks to protest against the Centre’s decision on strategic stake sale of DCI, an all-union meeting convened by the CITU resolved to organise demonstrations in front of all industrial establishments located in the city on Wednesday.

The online sale of rhino horn belonging to breeder John Hume will happen Aug. 21-24 and revenue will be used to “further fund the breeding and protection of rhinos,” according to an auction website. Van’s, a Pretoria-based auction house, is overseeing the sale and a “physical” auction will occur on Sept. 19, it said. Rhino breeders believe poaching would be undercut by a regulated trade in rhino horn, though critics say trade will spur poaching that has occurred at record levels in the past decade. Poachers killed 1,054 rhinos in South Africa last year, a 10% drop from 2015, according to the government. ‘Safely trimmed’ “Each rhino’s horn is safely and regularly trimmed by a veterinarian and capture team to prevent poachers from harming them,” it said, adding that Mr. Hume has a stockpile of more than 6 tons of rhino horn. This year, South Africa’s Constitutional Court rejected a government appeal to preserve a 2009 ban on the domestic trade, which was imposed as rhino poaching accelerated in response to growing demand for horns in parts of Asia, especially Vietnam. An international ban has been in place since 1977. Responding to setbacks in the courts, the South African government has drawn up draft regulations for a domestic trade and limited export of rhino horns. Those guidelines would allow a foreigner with permits to export “for personal purposes” a maximum of two rhino horns. Opponents of a legal trade argue that any exported horns would be hard to monitor and likely would end up on the commercial market, defying global agreements to protect threatened rhino populations. They say legalisation will spur poaching as illegally obtained horns are laundered into the legal market, similar to the exploitation of elephant ivory. Some consumers of rhino horn believe it can cure illnesses if ingested in powder form, although there is no evidence that the horn, made of the same substance as human fingernails, has any medicinal value. Rhino horn is also seen by some buyers as a symbol of status and wealth.",0

55,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fashioning-a-vision-of-the-future/article5575506.ece,opinion,None,Fashioning a vision of the future,"Very legitimate concerns have lately been expressed whether the new phenomenon on India’s political horizon, the Aam Aadmi Party, has evolved any theoretical perspectives on how to engage with the massive and complex problems of the vast country. Aside from the manifold issues of foreign policy, relations with neighbours, problems of caste, religion, communalism etc., what is its vision for the future economic growth of the nation? On the face of it, the AAP leadership does not appear to have given thought to these and does not appear to have a cogent, comprehensive theory to guide its actions. Yet, all actions do have some theoretical perspectives implicit in them, irrespective of the actors’ conscious formulation — or even awareness — of these. What perspectives inform the AAP’s recent chaotic actions? One major theoretical presence during much of the twentieth century was the Marxist theory which postulated social and economic transformation from one stage of development to another — from feudalism to capitalism to socialism, etc. Each transformation would be complete and comprehensive, replacing all preceding structures of the economy, polity, even modes of thought and behaviour; there were no shared spaces between one and another. Yet, history has demonstrated the existence of common spaces and the “transformation” from one “stage” to another was highly qualified by the continuing presence of older “structures” into their replacement. One of the decrees passed by the Assemblée nationale in Paris on 11 August, 1789, in the wake of the French Revolution, brazenly announced that “feudalism stood abolished from today”, heralding the onset of the bourgeois regime. Yet, as several historians have shown, so much of the preceding “feudalism” had survived that the term “Revolution” had lost a great deal of its sheen. In our own living memory, the Soviet Revolution in 1917 substituted socialism for the bourgeois “stage” in its totality; yet, after seven long decades of absolute dominance, socialism could not eliminate its predecessor which had obviously survived underneath with enough power to overthrow it in one swift move in 1990-91. Therefore, a different theory had to evolve, one that drew us away from binary oppositions. Interestingly, several recent experiments in Latin America in theory and in practice are exciting precisely because these modify both capitalism and Marxism. If Marxism posits social progress through contradictions, necessitating the elimination of one mode of production to ensure the installation of another, capitalism premises its (and society’s) growth on maximisation of private profit, never mind society’s urgent needs — especially the needs of those with minimal purchasing power — and the need to limit exploitation of natural resources to preserve ecological balance. Thus, when Venezuela placed an obligation on its big entrepreneurs to produce what the poor of the country required for subsistence even as the entrepreneurs earned legitimate profits, and when Ecuador granted a constitutional right to its ecology, the “contradiction” between capitalism and socialism was being modified. Socialism here did not predicate the abolition of capitalism and capitalism could no longer walk the free street of unfettered exploitation of natural resources for maximisation of profit. “Bio-socialism” is the beautiful term they have coined for this scenario. Representative democracy is also being complemented with participatory democracy in several countries to the extent of forcing governments to rescind laws already passed or decisions already taken. In other words, the existing institutions and systems need not be replaced by alternative sets of institutions and systems; these can be deployed for meeting society’s needs from the bottom upwards. The promises of liberal democracy, which had been defeated by the unfettered and unregulated growth of capitalism, as Noam Chomsky and several other thinkers have been arguing of late, can be met from within the system by reworking it. The urgent need at the moment is to implement the promises made by many democratic constitutions around the world instead of seeking to overthrow these bodies. Deliberation needed The AAP leaders clearly have not sat down to deliberate on these issues; but their slogans and actions have the appearance of holding the Constitution and institutions to their promises to the people of India, something along the lines of what’s happening in Latin America. When the movement started some two years ago at Ramlila Ground, the frightened political class first denounced it as a challenge to the venerable democratic institutions and then sought to sabotage it by making promises it had no intention of fulfilling. “Laws are made in Parliament and not in Ramlila Ground” was its war cry, typically seeking to mislead public opinion. “These unelected and unelectable men are insulting the temple of democracy, i.e. Parliament,” screamed leaders of the government and the Opposition in unison, even as for weeks and months together Parliament’s routine functioning was disrupted by them. Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal had never sought the substitution of Ramlila Ground for Parliament, but demanded that it pass a Bill in accordance with the will of the people. Mr. Kejriwal and his comrades have taken oath to honour the Constitution of India, not to abolish it and they are seeking to embed all their actions within the framework of given laws and institutions, but with a turn that had been ignored, even denied for so long. Clearly, the same institutions can be turned into the facilitators of or the stumbling blocks for society’s progress. That seems to be the perspective at work. How far will this take us? Some good distance, yes, but soon the demand for a conscious and clearer understanding of the nature of society and its aspirations and the modes of meeting them would certainly become acute. It is clear that any given model picked from somewhere and blandly enforced here would defeat itself. A long-term and sound vision alone can lead us to that distant land called the future. We cannot quite arrive there by kicking stones that lie as we walk; a clearer path needs to be laid out.

About ten publishing houses from Chennai put up stalls at the Fair. The mega event, they say, was an opportunity to observe and learn from global trends in the publishing industry. Though some Indian publications did manage to find their way into the global market, the country certainly has a long way to go on this front, they admit. ""We get a chance to understand what is the universal and abiding value in books. Most exciting of all is the chance to see the best books from different cultures and understand them. It also gives us an international profile,"" says Sandhya Rao, senior editor, Tulika Publishers. By the time the children's author, accompanied by publisher and managing editor Radhika Menon, returned to Chennai, a French publisher had already committed to one of their titles. Talking business The Fair, which was held from October 4 to 8, was a platform for publishers, printers, distributors and persons from libraries to talk business. There is hardly any scope for physical sale of copies, say publishers. It is more about trade of rights, they add. This year, India was the Guest of Honour at the fair. National Book Trust coordinated with publishers and ensured a considerable representation at the event. Publishers feel books published in India are looking better than they used to, with far more attention being given to packaging. Authors, printers and artists from Tara Publishing also took part in the Fair. A book made entirely by hand was the highlight of their stall. Tara's books have been published in 17 countries, with rights to over 75% of their titles sold in the international market. T.S. Srinivasan of the Giri Trading Agency got his English publication `Hinduism for all' translated into German just for the Fair. ""Thanks to the innumerable yoga institutes and ashrams around the world, visitors from other countries showed keen interest in such books,"" he says. V.K.S. Subhash of Sura books noted that books on education had a good market. ""Several factors such as technology and reading habit determine success in this field,"" he said. ""Better display needed"" However managing director of New Horizon Media Badri Seshadri feels India could have been showcased in a better way. ""The emphasis was more on our culture and diversity. At such a Fair, highlighting the features of our publishing industry would be more relevant,"" he says. ""Many publishers may have benefited individually in terms of acquisition, sale or exchange of printing and publishing rights. The Fair was a great learning experience. It revealed how much more can be done here,"" he notes.",0

He told the meeting that the compensation would be equivalent to the market value of the land. Mr. Chandy assured the meeting that a committee including elected representatives would be constituted to resolve complaints about the alignment of the four-lane highway. A video copy of the revised alignment would be provided to the people's representatives. The Chief Minister added that the land required for the project would be acquired only after compensating the families that would lose their land or buildings.

RAMAKRISHNA Arts College, OU: What does a train journey mean to you? A chance to escape the traffic? A much-needed break from the routine? An opportunity to indulge the child in you? And replenish your sense of wonder? Perhaps some combination of all these. It certainly is something that one would look forward to. After all, who wouldn’t like a window seat on a train! So, how would it be to take a train from Lingampally on the west end of Hyderabad to Secunderabad? Unique, both for the insights it offers into the city we think we know and for the time paths that it enables us to cross. As the train quietly rolls out of the tree-lined platform, taking along a passenger crowd mainly of college students and BHEL employees, one feels a sense of expectation and lightness that nothing else would give. Eventually one settles down as drama of the world unfolds outside the window. The buzz about the decade-long IT-driven boom won’t take time to hit you as dozens and dozens of new apartment blocks under construction make their appearance. Chandanagar being so close to the IT/BPO hub of Hitec City is undergoing a transition of sorts. Not quite the same for Hafizpet, also fairly close, which remains a working class neighbourhood. The speeding train rocks gently to a rhythmic tune and passengers are immersed in newspapers, cell phones, or conversations. Despite being a mix of social backgrounds, people are surprisingly quiet. Whatever happened to the loquacious Indian? Outside, the train glides smoothly through hillocks sprinkled with boulders that are typical of the Deccan landscape. In places, these rare rock formations are making way for luxury apartments and office blocks. A group of concerned citizens has tried to stop it but to what effect? Local builders continue to decimate them even after the story went so far as the New York Times (You can see the report by Somini Sengupta in the issue dated August 17, 2007). Here comes Hitec City, a place that embodies the new spirit of a city hitherto known for its historical relics – a long way from the city’s feudal past and hopefully an un-tinted employer for the region’s historically sidelined but newly aware generations. At the border between the city proper and the suburbs is the Sanathnagar Industrial Estate. With long trains loaded with shipping containers, cranes loading and unloading stuff, and – inevitably – the industrial effluents, it strikes one as a picture of productive activity but one that is quite a contrast from the cool, information-age workplaces of Hitec City. Begumpet -- known for its upmarket shops, restaurants, and hotels with the accompanying glitter and urbanity, is a place to be! But that is not the whole story. The native vegetation suggests that the ground underlying the elite Begumpet and the subaltern Hafizpet are little different. It gives one a strange feeling of something powerful keeping a watch. As Margaret Atwood would probably say, Nature waiting to take over? Perhaps because the train is an early morning one, or maybe that doesn’t matter, but one is treated to a sign of underdevelopment that befalls a third of Indians – people having to defecate in the open. This indignity is wholly avoidable and we must make sure it just ends. That’s about it! The train leaves us at Secunderabad, but are we the same people who got in?",0

The Ranji Trophy 2012 Group A game against Mumbai is definitely an opportunity for the India middle-order aspirant to show his batting solidity and the strokes at his command. He strengthened his claim for a place in the Test squad with a forceful knock for India ‘A’ against England (first innings top scorer with 93 off 150 balls) at the Brabourne stadium, where the four-day Ranji match will be staged. The Bengal skipper said, “England is a leading Test side, so it gives you a lot of confidence as you face quality bowlers.” Though Ajit Agarkar will be sitting out as he is recovering, Tiwary can still be tested by the new ball bowlers Dhawal Kulkarni, Kshemal Waingankar, Avishkar Salvi and spinners Ramesh Powar and Ankit Chavan. “We know Mumbai is a good side. We have quality bowlers and will look at them to attack,” said Tiwary. The four-day game on a wicket expected to generate bounce and pace is likely to be keenly fought, with the Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai going all-out to garner points. Bengal may face the heat from run-machines like Wasim Jaffer, Rohit, Abhishek Nayar, Suryakumar Yadav and Hiken Shah. Ajinkya Rahane and Ashoke Dinda are the notable absentees, as they are with the Indian Test squad. Mumbai has the batting depth to cover up when Rahane is away, but Bengal may miss Dinda more, given the current situation with the team having lost two games out of four. “Dinda was bowling really well and was named the best bowler in domestic cricket. We have in Shami (Ahmed) a bowler who took a hat-trick in a previous match. Looking at out attack I can say it is a decent one,” added Tiwary. Rohit, meanwhile, said, “we failed to get an outright win in the last three games. I believe we have to be more consistent and if we manage that, results will favour us. Tiwary will be looking to force a turnaround, with support from his experienced teammates in Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala and Sourav Sarkar who know what it takes to stretch Mumbai on home turf.",0

The police believe that Renjith was killed in retaliation to the murder of Communist Party of India (Marxist) activist Vanchiyoor Vishnu this April. They said the wanted men had been close associates of Vishnu and the group was involved, among other things, in the lucrative business of selling mud to realtors reclaiming wetlands for construction. Suresh and Krishnakumar, along with absconding ‘gang leader’ Om Prakash, are also accused in the killing of alleged mobster ‘Aprani’ Krishnakumar in 2007. Suresh was named as accused in the murder of ‘Changidi’ Vinod, an associate of Aprani Krishnakumar, in 2006. Hariprasad and Krishnakumar are the main suspects in the retaliatory attack on RSS activist Mohanan in the aftermath of Vishnu’s murder. The police said that some of the suspects were seen partying in front of the CPI (M) office at Vanchiyoor on the previous day of Renjith’s murder. A close relative of Vishnu was also present. The police have posted men in front of the office, the regular hangout of the main suspects in Renjith murder case, to prevent any retaliatory attack by RSS men. They said RSS cadres close to Renjith could retaliate against two top CPM leaders in the district if they suspected that the police were not doing enough to solve the murder. They said the suspects had initially planned to kill ‘Kakotta’ Manoj, one of the main accused in the Vishnu murder case. But he proved to be too elusive for the assailants. The police said Renjith’s killers arrived in front of his shop in two cars and one motorbike. They said a local contact helped the assailants. Investigators counted 49 injuries on Renjith’s body, an indication that there were more than five assailants. The police suspect that the conspiracy to kill Renjith was hatched at Muttathara and airport area. They are investigating an airport-based gang leader and CPI(M) functionary in connection with the murder conspiracy. Some of Vishnu’s associates had switched off their cell phones on October 16 and switched them on only after Renjith was killed. Investigators are viewing this action as a possible indication of their guilt. The police also searched the houses of one Deepu Dutt and his brother Balu Dutt near Muttathara for some suspects. They said the brothers had been arrested this year at Kovalam along with Krishnakumar and Karate Suresh on the charge of violating the Arms Act. The police also searched several premises in Mysore believing that Suresh could be hiding there. The police hope that mobile telephone calls made from Mannanthala and adjoining areas early on Friday will provide them clues about the identity of Renjith’s killers. The Crime Branch zeroed in on the culprits by identifying those who used their cell phones in the vicinity of the mobile phone towers near the murder spot at time of the crime. Assistant Commissioner K. Ramachandran and Circle Inspector K. E. Baiju are investigating the case.",1

To start with, the widening and resurfacing of the 2.4-km stretch of the 5-km bypass from Kanavi Gudda has been taken up at a cost of Rs. 3 crore. Traffic is not being allowed on the road during the day for three months from January 1. The entire 5 km-stretch has already been levelled. “Utmost care is being taken to ensure the quality of the road,” Deputy Commissioner Arvind Srivastav told The Hindu. The bypass was laid about five years ago. The bypass had become inevitable because of the pollution caused by the large number of lorries transporting iron ore from Sandur and Hospet that used to pass through Hospet city. Residents of Hospet had staged dharnas and blocked the movement of heavy vehicles in order to pressure the administration to begin work on the bypass and complete it early. But, with the heavy volume of traffic, the road surface got damaged. Traffic jams had become commonplace. Mr. Srivastav said that Rs. 5 crore more was needed to improve the remaining stretch of the bypass. He said mine owners and industrialists had promised to contribute Rs. 7.4 crore for the purpose.",1

For heroines, the most crucial one is the Lux test. The moment a heroine gets an opportunity to promote the soap brand, we get a feeling that she is on the highway to marquee. The latest to join the illustrious list is Asin. Coming from a family of academics, Asin says she never thought she would be in a field where beauty will be crucial to her success. “I believe in innate beauty because if you are beautiful from inside, it reflects on your face.” Going down memory lane, Asin says while being good at studies she was active in extra-curricular activities. “One of the activities happened to be modelling. The offer came in class 10 and happened to be a catalyst.” Those who have a way with books are generally considered lazy in taking care of their body but Asin happens to be an exception. After the initial buzz surrounding her first Bollywood flick, Ghajini, Asin doesn't seem to have got the kind of exposure she got down South. Asin obviously differs and says she is quite satisfied with her short innings in Bollywood and has some plum projects. “I am also working on a Tamil film Kaavalan.” Generally once an actor successfully crosses the Vindhyas, she doesn't look back to the home turf. “No, I have no fixed agenda. If I get a good offer I am open to simultaneously working in both the industries. I don't look at films from the regional point of view. I have a pan-India presence and perhaps that's the reason Lux has chosen me.” As for Hindi, she is again working in a remake called Ready. This time it is the remake of a Telugu hit of the same name. Directed by Anees Bazmi, Asin stars opposite Salman Khan, who is proving to be her benefactor post London Dreams. “I believe if my work is good I will be noticed. For that I don't need to go to parties or make news for reasons that don't emanate from my work.” ANUJ KUMAR",0

Ramana filed a case against the eight members in Dharmavaram police station accusing them of beating him up and even threatening to kill him. Provocation The provocation for the attack on Ramana was his conducting raids on several shops for detecting sale of powerloom sarees illegally. Meanwhile, thousands of members of the local weavers' community stormed the Dharmavaram town police station for parading some of their members half-naked and insulting them. They protested against the Circle Inspector's highhandedness. The police used mild force to chase away the weavers.

Thiruvasagam said here recently. “Last year, there was a problem filling up these seats. This year, it is the reverse. Hence, I have considered giving extra seats to colleges that have requested for more. But, this will be subject to two conditions. System Every college will be eligible for 20 per cent additional seats if they adhere to the system of providing free education to five students (applicable to all colleges) and also ensuring that there is a full-time principal,” the Vice-Chancellor said. Colleges that do not make provision for free seats would be denied the extra seats. Rural colleges would be given an additional 10 per cent over and above the 20 per cent. “This will ensure that students from rural areas do not have to travel long distances or stay in hostels to pursue higher education,” Mr. Thiruvasagam said. As regards the other condition of a full-time principal, he said more than 25 per cent of the colleges did not have a principal. There were many who came and went in the garb of acting principals. This was no use to the college, he said. Hence, if the above two conditions were fulfilled, additional seats would not be denied to colleges, he said.",0

In Gaza and Lebanon, in the refugee camps of Khan Younis, Rafah and Jabaliya, in Tyre and Beirut, in Nabatiyeh and Sidon, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children seek refuge. As they flee, they risk the indiscriminate wrath of an enemy driven by an existential mania that cannot be assuaged, only stopped. Ambulances are struck, humanitarian relief convoys are struck, United Nations observers are struck. Warning leaflets are dropped from the sky urging people to abandon their homes, just as they were in 1996, 1982, 1978, 1967, and 1948. The ultimately impossible decision in Gaza and Lebanon today is: where does a refugee go? In Beirut in July 1982, after surviving a bomb that destroyed a seven-floor apartment block next door to me, burying alive more than 40 persons taking refuge in its cellar, some of us began to sleep on the roof; there is no refuge from this terror, there is only resistance. Fifteen of the 37 children killed in Qana on July 30 were disabled; their families could take them no further north, according to Lebanese MP Bahia Hariri. From June to August 1982, Israeli aircraft flying over Lebanon dropped ""smart bombs"" on children's hospitals in Shatila camp, Gaza hospital, Acre hospital, and 11 of the country's orphanages, killing dozens of disabled children. They had nowhere else to shelter. The roofs had been painted with huge white crosses visible from the sky. That war did not give Israel the security it claims to seek, and nor will this one. In 1948, Palestinians fled after hearing news of the massacres in villages by Haganah forces and receiving leaflets dropped from the sky telling them to run for their lives. This week their grandchildren and great-grandchildren are being killed with impunity in the refugee camps of Gaza, where they are trapped. On July 28 alone more than 30 Palestinians were killed, with no international condemnation and barely a mention in the press. In Qana they were also trapped. ""We couldn't get out of our neighbourhood because there are only two roads leading out and the Israelis bombed them both several days ago,"" said Mohammad Shalhoub, a disabled 41-year-old survivor. The United States and Britain are claiming that no ceasefire is possible until there is an international force that will implement the U.N. Resolution 1559. Yet the Lebanese Prime Minister issued a seven-point plan in Rome last week, consistent with international law and agreed by all elected parties in Lebanon (including Hizbollah), that had as its first requirement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. It is implementation of the dozens of U.N. Resolutions that Israel has flouted for more than 50 years with protection from the U.S. and now from Britain that will stop this conflict. Infrastructure destroyed The capture of a soldier from an occupying army in Gaza, and of two soldiers on the Lebanese border by local resistance, in an attempt to force the release of thousands of illegally detained Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners, should have been dealt with by Israel in the framework of the laws of war and with a proportional response. Instead, by launching this massive attack, Israel has destroyed the social and economic infrastructure of a sovereign nation, Lebanon, just as it is destroying the infrastructure of a democratically elected administration in occupied Palestine. It is producing generations of refugees who will also resist. Power stations, bridges, key manufacturing and food factories in Lebanon are ruined, the entire industrial estate of Gaza pulverised. The ancient city centre of Nablus has been demolished. Whole villages in south Lebanon and sections of refugee camps in Gaza have been obliterated. These too are war crimes. If Britain will not stop Israel, nor condemn it, then under the Geneva conventions it is complicit in those crimes. Before seeking the implementation of the U.N. Resolution 1559, which calls for the disarmament of Hizbollah, Britain must seek with more sincerity the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which demand the immediate withdrawal of Israel from lands illegally occupied in the 1967 war, including the Golan Heights, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Gaza. There is hardly a statesman or citizen in the world today who cannot see that it will take outside intervention to stop Israel inflicting this terror. Calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, and working towards the implementation of all U.N. resolutions addressing this conflict, will restore to the international community and Britain in particular the legitimacy it has squandered by allowing months of war crimes to go by, witnessed but uncondemned and unconstrained. Israel has failed to understand that it cannot expel a people and call itself the victim; that it cannot conquer its neighbours and treat any resistance to that conquest as terrorism; that it cannot arm itself as a regional superpower and annihilate the institutional fabric of two peoples without incurring the fury of their children.

While farmers in the canal-irrigated delta areas are gearing up for the samba paddy cultivation; those in the non-delta areas are looking up to the skies for more rains. Paddy is expected to be raised on about 58,900 hectares of land in the district during the samba season this year. Agriculture Department officials expect paddy to be raised on about 36,400 hectares in the canal irrigated areas of the district and another 22,500 hectares in the non-delta areas. With most farmers in the district unable to raise the kuruvai crop because of the delayed opening of the Mettur reservoir, samba paddy has become the mainstay for farmers of the district this year too. Farming operations have just commenced and farmers have started raising nurseries in the canal-irrigated delta areas of the district over the past few days. Raising of nurseries is expected to gather momentum across the delta areas of the district in another week, Agriculture Department officials said. “The rainfall, though not enough, is a good augury. Farmers in Koundampatti and Etttarai areas have started raising nurseries after a spell of rain. The Public Works Department should ensure that water released in the Kattalai High Level Canal reached the tail-end areas to enable farmers to take up samba cultivation without problems,” said R. Subramanian, deputy secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association. The rain is expected to be beneficial to farmers going in for sowing of cotton, red gram, and cholam in rain-fed areas. However, farmers in the non-delta areas had to wait for more rain for taking up samba paddy cultivation. Over the past few years, wells have dried up and most irrigation tanks do not have much storage. Much would depend on the monsoon, farmers say. Agriculture Department officials expressed hope that there would be more spells of rain by the time farmers in non-delta areas go in for cultivation towards the month end.

The second and fourth semester exams of M.A., M.Sc. and M.com courses, which are crucial as they decide whether student will be promoted to second year or pass out of second year, have been scheduled from May 9. The first and third semester exams will be held from May 30. And the students seem to be in no mood to skip them citing the agitation as they have realised that they are crucial to complete the course. That the academic mood was back in place was reflected from the way the Ph.D. admission process was completed smoothly. “Our students are smart enough to understand that exams are crucial and they can't boycott them every time,” says B. Laxmaiah, OSD to Vice-Chancellor and who has dealt with students carefully at the peak of agitation as Dean of Students' Welfare. Repeatedly postponed In fact, the first and third semester examinations were scheduled on December 8, 2010. On the representation of the students they were postponed to December 18. But with the agitation in full swing and disturbances on the campus, they were further postponed. Meanwhile, the university went ahead with the commencement of class work for the next semester from December 22, 2010. These exams were subsequently scheduled from January 20 despite strong protests from students. Eventually, students of the campus and constituent colleges boycotted the exams while affiliated college students wrote the exams but in lesser numbers. The poor response could be gauged from the fact that out of 21,773 candidates only 3,391 appeared and the boycott was total in campus colleges. However, the university held exams for foreign students outside the campus ensuring that they didn't lose out. Senior teachers, concerned about the future of students, agreed that the university administration had made a smart move to conduct classes even as the exams were boycotted to ensure that the mandatory instruction days were met with. “This helped the university plan all the exams without losing much time,” agreed in-charge Vice-Chancellor D.N. Reddy. Meanwhile, students also made their intentions very clear recently when some of the JAC leaders declared that they would not be in a position to continue the agitation now as they had to concentrate on their upcoming exams. “In fact, a majority of the students were in favour of keeping the agitation and exams on different platforms. But the surcharged emotions after the release of Srikrishna Committee report made us to boycott exams,” a student leader agreed. Differences that cropped up between JAC leaders, who were mostly research scholars, and other students, who were mostly PG students, also reduced tension on the campus. Students declare that they cannot continue agitation as they have to concentrate on exams",1

But to make use of all the material received would take several columns, so I propose to restrict myself to the occasional stand-alone piece arising from this wealth of information-in-brief. One reader pointed out that the Simon Commission was announced 80 years ago, on November 9, 1927, and in the ensuing months several Indians in provincial governments resigned. Another pointed out that an impassioned appeal by Annie Besant in Madras played a considerable role in inducing these resignations. One of those who resigned from the Madras Cabinet on March 8, 1928 was A. Ranganatha Mudaliar, the Minister for Development, who had been inducted into politics by the Raja of Paanagal. Ranganatha Mudaliar, after Madras Christian and Law College, joined Government Service and became a Deputy Collector. But becoming a staunch Theosophist and inspired by Annie Besant, he helped in establishing the Young Men's Indian Association in 1914 and was instrumental in the building of Gokhale Hall, which was inaugurated in 1915. He was also responsible for starting the YMIA's branch in South Madras. It was in Gokhale Hall that Annie Besant gave her `Wake Up India' lectures and in 1916 - 90 years ago - founded the Home Rule League. Elected to the Assembly from Bellary, his was a voice often heard in the Legislature questioning the Government's nominees. It was a voice that was stilled when Besant, with whom he had gone to London as a member of the unsuccessful National Convention delegation in 1924, appealed, ""Awake, arise, men and women of every caste, class, community! Your mother's voice calls you to make her mistress of her own household. Do not desert her in her hour of need. Boycott the Simon Commission!""The first call for a boycott of the Commission was given by Sir P. S. Sivaswami Aiyer followed by Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Later, in Madras, early in 1928, the Legislative Council voted to boycott the Commission. The Premier, Dr. P. Subbaroyan, was one of the three members of the House who voted against the boycott. Besant's strident call followed. The Central Legislative Assembly also decided to have nothing to do with the Commission. When the Simon Commission arrived in Madras on February 26, they found themselves greeted by black flags and the city shut down by a hartal. A few days later, Ranganatha Mudaliar resigned together with fellow-Minister R. N. Arokiaswamy. He was, however, to persuade the Government to raise the statue for Annie Besant that now stands on the Marina. Ranganatha Mudaliar thereafter spent much time on Congress Party and Theosophical Society work till he was appointed the first Commissioner of the Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanam in 1935. During his four years of office he introduced the counting of cash every day, ordered a diamond kreedam for the Lord, and contracted Gannon Dunkerley to improve the road to the temple and make it a motorable one. In later life, Ranganatha Mudaliar teamed with V. R. Ramalinga Mudaliar to start a sugar mill - India Sugars - in Hospet.S. MUTHIAH",0

Very unlike the prosthetic costume teeth with which he made his film debut as Balan Chettan in Rajeev Ravi’s Kammatti Padam . The protruding, yellowed teeth became a part of him, he says. That is, once he got over the initial shock at seeing them. Since it was cinema he was hoping for some glamour; “in real life, while doing theatre, I was the mad man, the thief and the goon, in cinema I thought it’d be different.” “They (the prosthetic teeth) became a part of me, I removed them only when I ate or slept.” He still carries the teeth in his bag; a haircut has tamed the big hair. Words gush out, the phone buzzes constantly – life has changed, he says as he pauses to catch a breath. This was not his life a week ago. In Kammatti Padam , Rajeev Ravi’s raw take on the lives of those who live, sometimes kill, and often die on the margins of a city, Mani’s Balan is stunningly essayed. “The character has a lot of energy. Rajeev ettan told me the character was like a rubber ball – that was my brief.” The many Balans he saw while growing up in Thoppil, near Tripunithura, were his points of reference. He has seen lives as those in the film. There is pin drop, stunned stillness in movie hall when we first meet Balan Chettan . The shocked audience watches the frenzied, screaming Balan. He gives the scene his all. The applause from the crowd, during the rehearsals, egged him on he says. “I have done a lot of street plays; we derive energy from the applause.” Acting in the film gave him the satisfaction of doing theatre, which he calls the actor’s medium. He credits Rajeev for his work, for giving space for improvisation, be it the acting or the dialogues, providing the scope to showcase his talent. The compliments are pouring in, non-stop. He, along with Vinayakan, is the surprise package of the film. Mani is the man of the moment. “I hoped to perform well but I didn’t expect this. I am happy to have been acknowledged as an actor.”",0

Bayya Reddy, general secretary of KPRS, has said. ‘Applications rejected' Mr. Reddy told presspersons here on Tuesday said 12.5 lakh applications by farmers to regularise bagar hukum land, estimated at 31 lakh acres, had been rejected by the government. Apart from this, about four lakh applications, involving 12 lakh acres of land, were pending with the government, he said. ‘Form committees' He urged the government to regularise the land encroached upon by Dalits and small farmers and form village-level committee to speed up the process, he said. Only 7,500 families had benefited from regularisation and there were no beneficiaries from Uttara Kannada district, he said. Similarly, applications by farmers and workers, who had encroached upon the forestland, had also been rejected. The Department of Forests was forcibly evicting the encroachers from such land. The government should pass a Bill similar to the one passed in 2006 for regularisation of encroached land, he said. Demanding that the government fulfil the demands of KPRS, a State-wide agitation would be held in March. Jathas would be taken out from four corners of the State in the following month. In May, 50,000 people would stage a dharna in Bangalore to press for the demands, he said. He said the Chief Minister had promised KPRS a few ago that he would hold a meting to discuss the problem. The meeting should be held by the month-end. To pressure the government to hold the meeting, a non-political padayatra would be organised in 30 taluk headquarters. Mr. Reddy said that on February 28, a general industrial strike was proposed to be observed all over India. For the first time in the history, left, right and centrist trade unions had come together to oppose the proposal for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the retail market, he said. Manjunath Pulkar, Shantaram Naik, Gourish Naik, and Vishnu Naik of KPRS were present.

Patil Stadium here on Wednesday. Ross Taylor (31 not out, 30 balls) staged a lone battle as the visitor, chasing 185 for a place in the final, crumbled to 149 for nine in 20 overs. Kieron Pollard was adjudged the Man-of-the-Match. Sachin Tendulkar was absent owing to injury to fingers from the fourth over onwards in RCB's innings. Zaheer Khan stepped in to fill the breach. The skipper walked out at the finish to greet each teammate with a bear hug. Rayudu's efficiency behind the stumps, three wickets by Kieron Pollard apart from a run-out, timely strikes by Harbhajan and J.P. Duminy's well-judged catch on the ropes were the highlights of Mumbai Indians's work on the field. A berth in the Champions League is the first reward. RCB's batting response was entrusted to Dravid the opener, orthodox yet effective in using the pace generated by Zaheer Khan. He had the presence of mind to wait for the umpire's verdict when Tendulkar celebrated a catch at first slip. The Mumbai Indians captain walked off for treatment on injured fingers as the television umpire negated the catch. Harbhajan's knack of making things happen, complemented by Rayudu's reflexes behind the stumps, resulted in Pietersen's exit. The off-spinner saw the batsman stepping out, bowled down the leg-side and the wicket-keeper finished the task with a flourish, diving sideways to take the bails off. Uthappa left after a short burst, sweeping sixes off Harbhajan. Mumbai Indians appeared to have turned the tide when a fine piece of fielding by Pollard ran out Dravid (23 runs, 22 balls), collecting a throw from R. Sathish and flinging his body forward to effect a diving run-out, leaving RCB still to get a grip on the chase at the half-way mark (83 for two in 10 overs). Rayudu then latched on to an edge by Kohli. Rayudu and Saurabh Tiwary, busy as bees earlier at the crease, put on 67 runs off 49 balls in a fifth-wicket stand when the RCB bowlers were on top. Rayudu started with an imperious drive over the bowler's head, then scored 40 off 38 balls creating the launchpad for the big-hitters to follow. Tiwary cleared the ball with huge swings, using the bat like a sledgehammer for four sixes. Mumbai Indians scored 184 for five thanks to a five-over blast from Tiwary and some clean-hitting by Pollard (33 not out off 13 balls). The West Indian smashed three sixes. Mumbai Indians got a reality check about life without Tendulkar. The captain stretched outside the offstump to drive a Dale Steyn ball swinging away, scooped towards cover for Taylor to stun the home crowd into silence with a low, rolling catch. Kohli's sharp reaction cut short Shikhar Dhawan's short stint as five overs resulted in 39 runs and loss of both the openers. Duminy's apprehensions against spin came true, startled by bounce from Kumble. Rayudu and Tiwary were patient, working the ball around for singles to rotate strike. Mumbai Indians gained momentum in the 14th over bowled by Kohli. The scores: Mumbai Indians: S. Dhawan (run out) 12 (9b, 2x4), S. Tendulkar c Taylor b Steyn 9 (9b, 2x4), A.

The police said that the hotel security asked them to leave as they were creating an unpleasant scene. “But their clash continued outside the hotel,” the inspector said. Mr. Srinivasalu said that Gokul and Sowminarayan left the place in a car. Vishal and Sriram were returning home on their bike.

E.S. CHANDRASEKARAN, Chennai Since alcohol causes dilation of blood vessels due to release of histamine so increase in blood flow in vessels. The tiny blood vessels in sclera , the outermost layer of our eyes, become dilated causing bloodshot as well as hot eyes. Our cornea is transparent that's why we can observe the redness of eyes clearly. After some time it disappears. Some people tend to have red eyes very soon after drinking and for longer duration due to absence of enzyme ALDH2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase) which is responsible for the breaking of alcohol into acetic acid and vinegar in liver. This is genetic and very common in people of East Asian descent also known as 'Asian flush'. Persons with this disorder can develop crimson face, headache, nausea, hot eyes etc. even by consuming as little as one drink.

Is everyone seeking a BDA site in genuine need of one so as to have a roof over their heads? If so, then why do so many BDA sites not have houses on them despite the layout having been provided with basic civic amenities? Does this indicate that a large number of applicants are lying about not owning another site? BDA at fault The BDA’s own statistics reveal that it has not provided all basic amenities to parts of the layouts it formed as early as 1995. Be it J.P Nagar 8th and 9th Phases, for which land was acquired in mid-1990s, Banashankari 6th Stage and its further extension, or Anjanapura Layout and its further extension, for which land was acquired during 1999-2000, still lack some of the basic amenities. In Arkavathi Layout, land for which were notified during 2003-04, the BDA was neither able to complete allotment of sites nor has it started work on any basic infrastructure, including roads. Mandate ignored At the same time, in many of the blocks in the previously mentioned layouts, where basic amenities have been provided, the allottees have not bothered to construct their houses despite being given a deadline in the lease-cum-sale agreement. Interestingly, there are still vacant sites in HRBR, HSR, RMV Extension and other layouts that were formed in the 1980s. Rule 13 of BDA Allotment of Sites Rule 1984 (amended in 2005) stipulate that allottees should construct the house within five years from the date of execution of the agreement, failing which the BDA can either cancel the allotment and revoke the agreement after forfeiting 12.5 per cent of the site value. Prior to 2005, the Rule had imposed the deadline of two years for constructing from the date of agreement. No data available The BDA, though aware that a large number of sites are vacant, has no data of such sites to initiate action. In many instances, the sites are still vacant despite change of many hands after expiry of the 10-year bar on sale. “The law mandates that only those not owning sites and have been domiciled in Karnataka for not less than 15 years prior to the date of registration for allotment of site, are eligible for a BDA site. But neither BDA nor any other government agency has data of such persons,” points out a former advocate general. Where is the system? When thousands of acres of land belonging to farmers and others are acquired in the guise of public purpose of distributing it to eligible persons who don’t own sites, the government should have a system to identify genuine beneficiaries of such public allotment of a site at a reasonable price, he said and stressed the need for relook at BDA Act and Rules. “The failure to guarantee that all the allottees are in need of a site for shelter will certainly defeat the very concept of public purpose, the prime reason on which courts normally uphold acquisition of land for BDA layouts,” says Mahesh, an advocate. No sites in old layouts could have remained vacant if all the allottees were site-less as no one wishes to remain in a rented house for long, he pointed out.",0

Criticising the ad campaign launched by the Congress, she said it talks about water, power and road which had already been provided during Mr. Modi’s rule. Ms. Swaraj said her party has not softened its stand on India-U.S. nuclear deal and if it came to power in the Centre, it would cancel the deal as it was against interests of the country. On using services of Mr. Modi at the national level, she said the party wanted Mr. Modi to remain in Gujarat for completing the task assigned to him. She also claimed that rebels including Keshubhai Patel, Suresh Mehta and others would not have any impact on the party’s fortune in the elections.

Concern Expressing concern over the rhetoric indulged in wooing investors and launching mega projects, he said on the ground nothing was happening and the promise of doing business had been affected due to licence raj. “We often compare ourselves to China, an undoubted leader in manufacturing, whose government is very focused on fostering a business environment that is unmatched even in developed countries. If we are to match countries like China, which is seven to 10 years ahead of India, we would need to set our house in order to such an extent that when Apple CEO visits India, he comes looking to set up a base to make phones rather than just praise our talented youngsters,” he stated. Mr. Monish Row said projects like Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor, Sagarmala, PCPIR and Make in India would remain mere slogans and unemployment would continue to grow and the great potential of India would remain unfulfilled. “AP must take concrete steps to ease any political interference as well as inspection raj if we are to grab some share of the proposed investments in the years to come,” he said in the letter.",0

On the eve of the fourth ODI of the five-match series at the Chinnaswamy Stadium here, the Indian skipper said: “Our target is not winning the series 5-0 but it is about the next game. “Our target is to win the next match and continue with the momentum that we have gained in the first three matches.” Gambhir lauded his bowlers and said: “We have always got runs at the top of the order. Then the bowlers have always done well. “On flat tracks like in Jaipur or when the ball was doing a bit in the last match (Vadodara), they have stuck to their task and contained New Zealand. “In an ODI once the ball gets older it becomes difficult to contain and also in the third Power Play, but they have been working hard and they have won the series for us.” The Indian skipper also reiterated his earlier stated view of fielding the “best team in the park” though he has the added cushion of having won the series. Gambhir said that a player like Yusuf Pathan needs more opportunities to express himself. Destructive player “Someone like Pathan or Ravindra Jadeja hasn't got enough opportunities with the bat. Pathan is a destructive player. Our first four batsmen have done well but given a chance I would send him at number five,” Gambhir said. Meanwhile Daniel Vetorri admitted that his team was outplayed by India in all departments. “We failed to post enough runs by trying different things and also did not put pressure on the Indian batsmen. The Indian batsmen have played extremely well. Fine knocks “Gambhir played two fine innings. We've got to find a way to stop him. We are trying to improve but the pressure of losing to a good team is always difficult. “I think the present lot is good enough to win the game but there may be a couple of changes here and there,” the New Zealand captain said and added that having former England coach Duncan Fletcher as a consultant will provide a fresh perspective to his team that “is in a rut.”",0

Friends and allies say the steely resolve exhibited at the rally is often seen in the man who competes in triathlons, is addicted to extreme sports and once escaped from the clutches of gun-firing bandits while stumping for votes in a pro—government slum. The trait has been evident in recent months as he emerged as head of an increasingly powerful opposition faction that is pushing for a stronger, but non-violent confrontation with the government. Mr. Lopez, 42, surrendered to authorities after a weeklong manhunt to face charges including terrorism and murder stemming from the unrest that erupted after a big anti—government protest he led Feb. 12. Most demonstrators had gone home before the deadly clashes began. After a week marked by nightly clashes between police and students, dozens of detentions and the expulsion of three U.S. diplomats, the threat of more violence hung over Mr. Lopez’s public surrender in front of thousands of supporters at the same time government backers held a rival march organized by Mr. Maduro to denounce a “fascist” conspiracy to topple him. But Mr. Lopez’s repeated appeals for restraint and a strong police presence calmed emotions and there were no reports of major violence in Caracas. Foreign governments have shown scant interest in pressing Mr. Maduro since he was elected 10 months ago — AP",1

Muskan Ahirwar started the small library — ‘Bal Pustakalaya’ — with 25 educational books last year at her residence in Durga Nagar, a slum located barely a kilometre away from the state secretariat in Bhopal. The 11-year-old girl’s efforts have now been recognised by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who has offered her a financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to set up a proper library. Chouhan met the girl at his residence on Wednesday and handed her a cheque of Rs 2 lakh. He promised Muskan to build a one-room library for her, an official of the public relations department said. “The situation would soon change if girls like Muskan are extended support by the whole society. The government will extend all possible support,” Chouhan said while handing over the cheque to the girl. Muskan started the library with merely 25 books which, she says, has “now grown and accommodates around 1,000 books.” The girl lost hope of continuing the library after the death of her father, Manohar Ahirwar, on July 7 this year. However, after receiving the financial assistance from the chief minister, the girl says now nothing can stop her and the other slum children from moving ahead. “Papa used to say do something big, study hard,” says Muskan, who wants to be a doctor. Her library remains open between 5 pm and 7 pm every day. “Nearly 20 to 25 children come to the library (every day). They have to sit on a mat. A few children take the books to their homes and return it later. In a bid to know if they read the books, I sometimes ask questions from it,” she says. Muskan says she also maintains a register of the library’s accounts.PTI",0

This year too, over 400 children of all age groups have enrolled for the three-week long camp that started on May 8. Considered one of the best in south India, the Sir Vizzi complex is equipped with three pools, including one for toddlers. It has produced many national swimmers, for which credit goes to senior coach Sambasiva Rao, who was instrumental in identifying and nurturing many talented swimmers. “The summer camp is the right place to spot natural talent. The month-long interaction of the boys and girls will enable us to identify the precocious talent. But, unfortunately, not many return to the pool once schools and colleges reopen. This has been the curse of the sport,” laments Mr. Rao. The sprawling complex turns into a beehive of activity from 6 a.m. with dozens of parents with their wards descending to watch their dear ones learning the nuances of the sport, considered the mother of all sports. With swim accessories such as head gear, sunglasses, bright tight-fit swim suits decorating the youngsters, the complex wears a festive look. Safety aspect However, Mr. Sambasiva Rao is a worried man as he is more concerned about the safety of the children. “Though swimming is the best sport for the overall development of human body, it is equally dangerous. It is getting difficult to monitor all the 400-odd swimmers splashing in the three pools and we want the parents to cooperate with us by keeping a watch on the children both inside and outside the pool,” he says. Mr. Sambasiva Rao also feels the need for more coaches for the effective conduct of the camp. “Along with me we have two coaches and two senior swimmers to monitor the camp, but this is insufficient,” he says.",0

The former Minister S.K. Kanta is leading the agitation. The organisers of the bandh, which included many Kannada organisations, Dalit organisations and heads of a few religious maths, there was no was force on the business establishments and hotels to close their establishments, and everybody's support for the bandh call appeared voluntary. Though the police had assured people of full protection during the bandh, most business establishments remained closed. Only a few autorickshaws were seen plying on the roads but almost all shops in the city remain closed. The North Eastern Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) also did not operate the city services. The NEKRTC, however, operated the mofussil and long distance services as usual after the police assured the corporation that security would be tightened. However, the private operators plying on long distance routes kept their vehicles off the road.

The protesters raised slogans against the State Government and the police for arresting nearly 70 Dalits after an incident in which stones were thrown at the police personnel at Tarfail slum. They alleged that the police tried to intimidate religious leaders and pressured them to withdraw the bandh call and had issued notices to them saying that if there was any untoward incident during the bandh they would be held responsible for it. Incidentally, this is for the first time that the police had slapped notices on the organisers of the bandh citing the Supreme Court ruling holding the organisers of the bandh responsible if any untoward incident occurred during the bandh period. Notices were also served to Mr. Kanta. Neither had the swamijis nor Mr. Kanta accepted the notices and the police personnel had pasted the notices on the doors of the religious math and at the venue where Mr. Kanta was on hunger strike.",1

Over the last three months, Mr. Beuve has researched their origins and the centre is in the process of putting up signages of the commercial uses and myths that surround these plants. “My objective was to go beyond names. Often botanical gardens do not captivate people. My research on these species led me to interesting tales on their origins and nomenclature which we will display. This garden in a cultural centre reflects exchanges from around the world,” Mr. Beuve told The Hindu . “There are 60 species here right now”, he said and added that it increases to more than 80 in the spring. “I have identified 56 of them. Only a third of these species are from Asia and a third each are from the Americas, Africa and Oceania,” he explained. Le Jardin Botanique is spread across the four storeyed building which has housed Alliance Française since 2004. The campus retains the Pilkhan and Mango trees inherited from the Lutyens’ bungalow that preceded the new building. The tales around the plants are many. The twin-winged Calabash trees at the entrance, for example, greeted the Spanish conquistadores when they landed on the shores of Central America in the sixteenth century. “It's crossed shaped leaves made them believe that there was divine sanction for colonising the continent. The trees here are not just ornamental. They have medicinal value and can be used for textiles too,” Mr. Beuve said. Champa or White Frangipani gives off a white secretion that can supposedly cure warts but can also be used as poison. “In India people are much more in touch with nature due to the religious significance of plants. That is something we have not seen in Europe since the Middle Ages,” he added. The curtain creeper, which is commonly found in South Asia, Beuve added can also stop nosebleeds. “It's bark can be smoked like a cigarette to stop nosebleed. There are several other plants here that can also be smoked but I am not highlighting that as people may start smoking them,” Beuve explained. Visitors can add to the resource by providing Hindi names for plants whose local taxonomy has not been mentioned. On Wednesday, the endeavour was inaugurated by Pradeep Kishen, who authored the book Trees of Delhi . Kishen and Beuve took nature enthusiasts on a guided tour of the premises.",0

Apparently, it does. A coating of nano-materials yield better results on a plethora of applications such as waterproof coats, heat shields, self-cleaning surface coats, coatings for preventing efflorescence/oil deposition/rust/mould/algae growth, sealants, and restoring fluids. That is because nano-sized materials have unique properties compared to ordinary material or molecules. Recently launched in India is Greece-based NanoPhos SA range of products, developed by Vasilis Theoharakis and Loannis Arabatzis, who are both doctorates in nanotechnology. “Water-based NanaPhos applications are more efficient than conventional hybrid or polymer based applications because, nano-particles in water penetrate into pores and coat them without sealing the surface. This averts the formation of films or polymer chains, which allows the building surface to breathe. And since no film is formed, there is less risk of mechanical wear or cracks developing on the coating, which implies that just a single application has a longer shelf life”, says G. Sampath Kumar, ATG Nano Systems, a distributor of NanoPhos products in India. ATG NanoPhos has received assignments from many clients, including Archaeological Survey of India, to make Vellore fort’s surface waterproof. “At NanoPhos, we have studied Indian climatic conditions and have designed our products to be effective in harsh weather conditions as well, in order to withstand the heat, humidity and rain,” says Theoharakis. Coatings can be applied anywhere with a brush, roller or spray and can be used both in indoor and outdoor conditions, on a variety of surfaces such as cement, concrete and natural stones like marble, rough granite, dolpur stone, sandstone. Designer tile, tile grout, clay tiles, wire cut bricks, ceramic tiles, vitrified tiles, Mangalore tiles, pottery, porcelain sanitary ware, wood, gypsum board, plywood, packing carton, glass, solar panels, aluminium roofs and other metal surfaces such as vehicle roofs can also be coated.

The curtain-raiser by Natya Tarangini Kuchipudi dancers trained under the Reddy Parampara of Raja/Radha and Kaushalya, was a group presentation entitled “Sparsha Ballet”. Sparsha in Sanskrit has several connotations of touch, of contact, of encounter, of tangibility, of sensation and of sensitivity (sparsha lajja), used in reference to the sense organs too. Stringing all these ideas into dance images showing man’s awareness of the five cosmic elements — air, water, Earth, the sky and fire — and the sense of wonder in sparsha of the indriyas or sense organs, to the ultimate expression of oneness in the Shiva/Shakti symbolism leading to creativity and to the man/woman bond through marriage and the mother/child tie, Sparsha was expressed through myriad situations. Set to Sanskrit verses by Vedavyasa Ranga Bhattar and sung to Sheshachari’s ragamalika score, the ballet despite technical hiccups caused by sound and the recorded music playing fast and loose, did not miss out on cues — even the youngsters not floundering during interruptions. Raja/Radha appeared briefly as the Shiva/Shakti couple and seemed in some physical discomfort. Having trained so many students for years, some among them finished dancers, the duo can think in terms of giving larger roles to the youngsters, lessening their own burden. As the sutradhar, Rashmi Vaidyalingam was most impressive despite fleeting appearances. The scene with the four couples after the marriage hymns were recited seemed over stretched. The mother rocking the baby in the cradle was a moving scene. Costumes were aesthetic. Malavika Sarukkai’s Bharatanatyam performance is one of the best from this dancer in recent years. The Vasant Ritu interpretation of verses of Kalidas caught the varying images of Nature at her most resplendent with a veneration showing a dancer deeply immersed in evoking the mood of the moment. The sringar images which followed with Manmatha in full cry with his flowered darts aimed at various persons, with singer Nandini Anand’s musical imagery in full consonance with the dance interpretation, made for evocative moments. The high point of the recital was yet to come in “Maninam” based on Kamba Ramayanam verses showing women responding to the first look at valorous Ram as he enters Mithila. As some enter leaping like deer, and some like the graceful peacock, others dart in between the crowds and some gleam like scattered stars in the sky - all eyes falling on a part of Rama, remaining riveted to the spot with no consciousness of the rest of the hero — for in each part lay the splendour and effulgence of the whole. As Nandini Anand broke into Kamas with “Tol Kandaal tole kandaal” the dancer brought out sringar/bhakti in all its intensity. The finale based on Oothukadu Venkatasubbaiyer’s Kalinga Nadanam tillana was unlike the customary items in this genre — for here recitations, nritta passages and the picture of Krishna dancing on the serpent hoods are all combined in a form where rhythmic cadences and tones keep changing — and Malavika’s visualisation, with all the surprises, created the perfect mood. With a fine group of musicians and percussionist, Malavika was in full form, her Bharatanatyam with distilled intensity rather than virtuosity. Astad Deboo on the final evening of Parampara in “Rhythm Divine” interacted in his contemporary dance vocabulary with Manipuri pung cholom specialists. Amazingly versatile, these drummer/dancers, in moving in the oh-so-slow fashion that Astad prefers, have a sense of timing and of incredibly coordinated group discipline, which make working with them a pleasure for Astad, whose style seems to have such a fine jugalbandi relationship with movements deriving from Manipuri and Thang Ta. Every rasa from fear to daring to joy was brought out through abstract movement. As for Astad, with stances through his body arched backwards and non-stop pirouetting dervish like, and movements with body angled in impossible profiles, wonderment, merriment, and every rasa was evoked. The artistic music mixing with western music, opera, Japanese Shamisen, different types of gongs, added to the presentation. One part in particular with the sound of gunshots and constant drone of war planes, with the Manipuri dancers creating beauty of movement, was a stark reminder of today’s world with all its terror amidst beauty — and a strong message of what is happening in Manipur with constant turmoil, amidst which artists are trying to create aesthetics.",0

Farhan Akhtar and the cast of Rock On!! 2 are busy shooting in and around the capital city of Meghalaya. Rock On!! introduced the audience to Farhan’s acting and singing abilities. The sequel will be no different. “I have recorded three songs for it,” says the actor. The music, as the title of the film suggests, will be within the genre of rock. “But it’s evolved over the last eight years. That was more garage rock-like. Now, the music is a lot more contemporary,” he says. The movie is set to release in November this year. Ten films old and Farhan says he doesn’t have a preferred film genre, but he does like drama. He also enjoys action movies. “We have grown up in an era where every film ended with an action sequence,” he says. Farhan’s last release, Wazir , is perhaps the only action film he’s acted in. About his upcoming projects, he’s looking forward to the movies he’s producing: there’s Baar Baar Dekho , a rom-com, and Raees that stars Shah Rukh Khan. Actor, director, singer, producer, writer — he’s ticked all of that. Is there something else he wants to experiment with next? “For now, I want to explore and challenge myself more in these areas,” he says. It’s been a little less than three years and Farhan Akhtar is going to be back in Chennai to perform here for the second time. The event was scheduled to take place in December last year, but had to be postponed due to the floods. “I am looking forward to it. This is our way of getting some good cheer back to the city.” All the recording for Rock On!! 2 did serve as a good practice session for him for his live performances. There are quite a few lined up this year. Prior to Chennai, he will perform in Pune, Lucknow and Delhi. The concert will feature all his hit tracks, including ‘Senorita’, ‘Dil Dhadakne Do’ and ‘Atrangi Yaari’... “No matter how much you plan, you end up doing something else,” he grins and adds, “We just hope people have a great time.” (Farhan Live, organised by Touch and Vajra, will be held on February 6 at 7 p.m. at Amir Mahal Palace, Teynampet.

When a new bridge comes up near it on the Kollam-Theni National Highway 220, the bridge built in 1903 will be closed to traffic. The 96.20 meter-long-bridge is too narrow to accommodate two-way traffic. During peak hours, logjams are common on the bridge. Taking cognisance of these facts, a decision was made to construct a new bridge. Unlike other British structures in the district there is not much data available about this bridge. Vandiperiyar grama panchayat president G. Vijayanand says the bridge was built to ease traffic flow in the High Ranges after Kumily emerged a main town following the construction of the Mullaperiyar dam. Two roads constructed by the British during this period were the Kottayam-Kumily road and a road which was extended to Kattappana. Of the many bridges built using stone between Kumily and Kottayam, the Vandiperiyar bridge was the only one on which vehicles still plied. “Initially heavy vehicles carrying goods used the bridge, later it was thrown open to general traffic,” Mr. Vijayanand said. Other bridges like the ones at Kauntharuvi and Karinkulam Chappathu were replaced by new bridges. Karinkulam bridge still remains as a symbol of British architecture. The government has decided to preserve the Vandiperiyar bridge as it was constructed over a century ago. When the construction of a new bridge was announced in the last State Budget, shopkeepers refused to cede land for it. Later, they relented and decided not to demolish the old bridge to make way for the new one, but to preserve it as a monument to the British era. “The bridge is an architectural wonder. The steel railings on either side of the bridge provide space for pedestrians to stand,” said Muthusami, a shop owner.",0

Though many disabled people have worked hard and proved their mettle, the lack of support has left them dismayed. B. Samiullah, a 24-year-old weightlifter, is one such person who is struggling despite bringing glory to the State. Both his legs were affected by polio when he was three years old, and Samiullah uses his hands to remain mobile. He has participated in several weightlifting competitions in the State and outside and has won medals. The passion for weightlifting was kindled when he was in first year pre-university. His close friend took him to a gymnasium where he saw men lifting weights. “I wanted to become a sportsperson, but in view of my disability people advised me to take to chess. But I wanted to do something different and challenging and chose weightlifting,” he said. He joined a gymnasium and working hard. Samiullah secured a gold medal when he participated for the first time in a championship in Mangalore in 2004. He got the first prize in the 52 kg category by lifting 110 kg. He was also selected as the strongest man of Karnataka in the same event. “But permission to participate in the competition came with difficulty as my application was rejected on the ground that I am disabled. But I fought and got the permission,” he said. Securing the gold medal by competing with normal people was something great, Mr. Samiullah said. The gold medal boosted his morale and he participated in several competitions thereafter, including the national-level competition held in Jharkhand in 2005. There, he secured the bronze medal. At State-level contests, he has secured gold and silver medals. But financial difficulty proved a hindrance to his dreams.He could not participate in the national-level championship in Delhi in December 2006. “With great difficulty we arranged Rs. 15,000 to send him to Jharkhand. Sami’s mother pledged her gold earrings to arrange the money. With a meagre pension of Rs. 3,000, it is not possible for me to arrange to send him to all competitions,” Mr. Samiullah’s father, Bashasab, a retired driver, said. Mr. Bashasab, who was employed with the Public Works Department, said their financial state did not allow him to help his son pursue his passion. He said the family had been asking Mr. Samiullah to stay at home, but he is obsessed with weightlifting. Mr. Samiullah said he wished to participate in the national-level championship to be held in Mangalore in January next year, but had been told that the new norms did not allow disabled people to participate. “I am in touch with the organisers to get the rule changed. Even if I get a chance, I don’t know how to arrange the money,” he said. His father pointed out that except for a tricycle, Mr. Samiullah got nothing from the Government.",0

148,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/When-mass-meets-class/article15472938.ece,features,metroplus,When mass meets class,"It’s an innocuous-looking house at the end of one of the bylanes in Valasaravakkam. The only giveaways are the groups of eager hopefuls waiting outside and the kids in the neighbourhood who line up for yet another chance to take a photograph with the Makkal Selvan. Inside the distinctly-masculine space of Vijay Sethupathi Productions is parked a recent acquisition — a gleaming Triumph. It’s 9.30 p.m., but there’s an air of expectation in the waiting space. Some have come to narrate a story; others to seek a part; and some possibly to catch a glimpse of the man who’s blurred the line between class and mass, and who is proof that it is possible to be showered by elusive stardust despite being an actor. Aandavan Kattalai , his fifth release this year, is running to packed houses and Rekka releases today, but Vijay Sethupathi’s usually animated face is devoid of any apparent expectation or joy. “Why are numbers so important? I take up a film I like, give it my best, and move on,” he says in a nearly 90-minute chat. The actor is just back from Pune, where he was shooting for K.V. Anand’s film, and has been at office since 7 p.m. Vijay’s days are typically long. “I’ve committed to films, and must keep my word. For that, I’ve to work, irrespective of time,” he smiles. And, every time someone mentions the number of hits he’s clocked up this year, the actor wonders why. “Before Naanum Rowdy Dhaan , people in the industry said I’d given four flops in a row. In cinema, we should attempt to do well. Some work and siladhu mokkai aagum … but the trying must never stop.” Does Vijay ever wonder how he’s managed to lend star power to small gems? “I do yes, but my name works well for some films. If a producer has a Rs. 50-crore budget, he’ll meet another star; he must recover the money.” Even five years ago, the actor was not well-known; today, he’s the toast of tinseltown. However, not much has changed in his demeanour. Vijay still goes out with his family, meets fans and bonds with his buddies. “I believe life is an ‘experience ball’. You throw it at someone, it picks up their response… it grows. You play with that ball, learning what it teaches you. Your present is shaped by your yesterday, but you don’t have to advertise it.” At the same time, he firmly believes that his stardom is “dependent on the person watching my film. And, a hit or flop is only for 10 days; what matters is what I did”. Even as a struggler, Vijay was choosy. “I’d see a poster and go ask for a role. I’d avoid some sets; I’d never approach ‘big hero’ projects. I used to love a director for his ability to extract great performances; I begged his associates for just two days on his sets… And, before I knew it, six years passed. There was television ( Penn ), a Kannada film, some Tamil films, short films… in all this, I’d learnt how to ask questions and whom to approach. I’m self-taught. Even today, on the sets, I probe the lightmen, the stunt artistes… they are from a period I’ve not seen; I can visualise it through them.” Continued on page 6 From page 1 Does all this aid him in character study? “I don’t do that. Ninety per cent of a film’s mood is set when the writer visualises it. Like you behave differently in a temple and at a party, I transform based on the set. I’m happy even if the dialogues are given to me at the last minute,” he says. “No, I don’t have a photographic memory… I was a below-average student,” he laughs. It’s hard to believe that when Vijay recites some of his favourite scenes — the ‘drunken prawn’ scene of Kadhalum Kadanthu Pogum , crucial sequences from Iraivi … and during moments like that, it’s hard to know if you’re sitting in front of Pandian, Michael, or Vijay . “If you don’t see me act, my work is done. The actor must never take the character beyond the scope of the movie,” he says. For someone who does not like watching himself on screen, Vijay has a few favourite moments. The drunken prawn scene, for instance, saw him “fix a rhythm in dialogue delivery. In the same sequence, my fake anger and my laughter when asked if we could marry… all were worked on.” In a way, this Nalan Kumarasamy film also helped Vijay realise his potential. “I told him… thalaivaa , I’ve realised something as an actor. I hope I’ll approach films differently hereafter.” Which is why he asked Arun ( Sethupathi ), Karthik Subbaraj ( Iraivi ) and his mentor Seenu Ramasamy ( Dharmadurai ) for freedom to explore his character. “In a way, it is calculated creativity. I felt that in Dharmadurai , I must break down after Aishu’s death after a pause. That, in Iraivi , I must kneel by Anjali after she makes me realise I’m wrong… I’ll give the director what he wants, but please explain the requirement. If it reaches me, then there’s communication.” Vijay admits he’s respectful, sometimes in awe, and a rasigan of his directors and their ability to conceive scenes. “They are necessary to guide us well, not merely rein actors in. An actor is not a runaway horse, but one that is walking a different path and must be brought back.” Among the many films he’s done, Vijay is especially fond of some, especially the ones that did not reach the intended audience. Like Pannaiyarum Padminiyum and Iraivi . “Without getting preachy, Karthik Subbaraj showcased how women perpetuate injustice against women, and how men feel entitled. It was a semma padam , but some people approach a film with a pre-fixed notion.” Does screen image ever matter to Vijay? “Never. I want to make my kind of films, but make them work commercially too. When my presentation meets the director’s imagination, the result will be great.” Logic drives every sphere of the actor’s life. Be it using his renovated Java motorcycle for K.V. Anand’s film (“It required a manly look!), humouring fans who clamour for photographs (“They are happy with just two minutes of your time”) or wanting children to learn life lessons and go beyond academics. But that logic is backed by solid craft and the high of creating a cinematic memory. “Director Manikandan once asked me how I balanced varied genres… but is my job not that? I’m excited and nervous about every film; once I understand the medium fully, I’ll relax,” says Vijay. Has his success bred competition and a changed lifestyle? “I’m friendly with all; we share cinema. But, I have my personal friends who come home. And, I keep my family away from all this, because I’m afraid stardom will affect my children. I might gift them an expensive watch, but it should be precious because appa bought it, not because of its monetary value.” Vijay’s films might have raked in crores at the turnstiles, but did you know the actor has stepped out of Tamil Nadu only thrice, and travelled abroad just once for shoots? “That’s true.

Did you see the Niagara Falls?” I would often get asked, and I always had to say ‘no’. I had not seen it on my previous visit two years ago. I had not even been remotely near it. But I would quickly add: “I saw the Rockies, the breathtakingly beautiful mountain ranges. And actually took a helicopter ride over them for a fabulous aerial view! I also saw the exquisite totem poles in Stanley Park. And oh, the craft demos in Granville Island were quite something. Also, amazing Vancouver — regarded as one of the loveliest and most liveable cities in the world….” But the question always came back to “How about the Niagara?” Finally, now, I can answer all those questions with a resounding ‘yes’. I saw the Niagara Falls…. in seven different ways. Actually more... if you count the many times I gazed at them in fascination, nose pressed to the car window, every time we drove past them on our way to other places in and around the city. The Niagara Falls are so ingrained in the average person’s mind, that even those who agree that I did see a few spectacular sights wonder why I did not also see the falls. After all, not only are they a natural wonder, but the experience from the Canadian side is universally considered more awesome than that from USA. I first saw it from the Skylon Tower’s Revolving Dining Room restaurant, which promises “the ultimate falls-view dining experience” from a height of 775 feet above the falls. The mighty, majestic, thundering falls were a stunning sight. Jaw-dropping! It was hard to focus on the food or anything else. Walking from there to the Illumination Tower for the ‘I lit up the Falls’ experience, I saw thousands of visitors watching the sight from the facing road, standing behind a railing, not minding the spray from the falls or the drizzle from the rain above. The Niagara Falls are illuminated every night. They are lit up in different colours, and the controls are with the Canadian side for both countries. We entered the tower and were guided to the console by the manager. For a few magical moments, I gained the power to change the colours of the falls as viewed on both sides — USA and Canada. Red, blue, green, yellow... I watched fascinated, as the entire stretch of the mighty Niagara Falls was bathed in different colours. Next morning, I was breathless with excitement as the ‘Journey Behind the Falls’ began. There are two observation decks and portals to view the falls from and feel their might. It is the closest an average person can get to them. First, we took an elevator that descended 150 feet through bedrock to reach the tunnels. On reaching the deck and descending a few steps, I stepped onto the observation deck. And there it was – roaring, thundering sheets of water. The mammoth cascade of water left all the viewers speechless with awe. We were being drenched by the spray, blinded by the mist and elbowed by the crowds of tourists. But who would mind that? Even before we had recovered, it was time for the ‘Voyage to the Falls’ boat tour on Hornblower Niagara Cruises. The boat travels up to both sides of the falls, allowing direct views of the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side, the Great Gorge, American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls. The anticipation grew as the boat inched closer and finally reached a few feet short of the cascade. It paused there. The boat erupted in a frenzy of excitement. Many screamed in delight. The gigantic cascade was a breathtakingly beautiful sight. The mist and spray were almost blinding and the roar of the water was deafening. Canada’s Horseshoe Falls is the largest of the three falls. The volume of water is so large that it can fill one million bath tubs every minute. Taking a turn, the boat proceeded to the Bridal Falls and American Falls for another thrilling experience. There are two hydroelectric plants which draw the water into their reservoirs before it reaches the falls and their intake determines to a large extent the actual volume of water flowing over the falls. The time of year and day affect the amount of water being drawn away. The same evening, another Hornblower boat took me to the falls again, for a night view on what is called a ‘Fireworks and Illumination Cruise’. It was another up, close and personal view of the falls, accompanied by a splendid show of fireworks, which lit up the night sky. But there was more. An aerial view of the Niagara Falls is regarded a special thrill. However, that is possible only if the weather gods smile on you. Tourist helicopters do not operate in less-than-perfect weather. The four-seater (pilot included) Niagara helicopters flew a group of tourists and me over and around the Niagara Falls, as we took in the spectacular views of the falls from above. The Niagara Falls tend to freeze in extreme winter, so check the time of the year before planning your visit. But then again, this sight is also considered a special winter wonderland! So, take your pick. Either way, it will be an experience of a lifetime.",0

Srinivasan. Twenty years have passed by but Kerala is yet to find a men’s table tennis player in the class of Srinivasan, the stylish star who went on to become the India No. 5 and played at the 1997 World championship in Manchester. Lean and tall and almost like a Pinocchio in appearance with his long nose, the poker-faced Srinivasan appeared to be all hands and legs in lightning speed those heady days as he jolted some of the giants on the national circuit. “Unless you go out, it is going to be very difficult for our boys to do well in the men’s national circuit,” said Srinivasan, the 11-time Kerala winner and three-time Tamil Nadu champion in the mid-nineties, in a chat with The Hindu here on Wednesday. “For girls it is okay, you can spar with boys but boys need quality sparring partners to succeed and this is sorely lacking in Kerala.” Srinivasan dominated the Kerala circuit for years but he was not satisfied. He dreamed of bigger things and after finishing his engineering, the youngster moved to Chennai at 23 and began training at V. Chandrasekhar’s academy. “The current players in Kerala are satisfied with State titles. Even if they are good, they do not want to venture out and join some big academies and try bigger things,” said the 43-year-old who occasionally coaches youngsters at the JDT Academy in Kozhikode. “The problem is, the boys just look at getting admission into professional colleges. I’m happy that some of our girls, from Alappuzha, are doing well, some of them are sponsored by corporate giants, so there is enough incentive to do well. “But the men’s standard is very high when compared to the women’s. If you observe the results lately in the national circuit, the 38-year-old Anindita Chakravarty reached the finals in one of the zonals. You can’t expect such a thing in the men’s section, even entering the quarterfinal would be tough for the seasoned stars.”",0

Those are excerpts from recorded conversations between Tulshidas Desai, marketing manager of OHeraldO (the Herald) and Goa-based journalist Mayabhushan Nagvenkar.

Just as in the recent Lok Sabha elections, we have to defeat the CPI(M) in the Assembly elections too… And we will remove them democratically and politically, without any violence.” Many Trinamool supporters from all over the State congregated at the rally despite the rain. “Let it rain. It will usher in a shower of change in West Bengal,” she told the crowd. She offered homage to the victims of violence during the agitations at Singur and Nandigram. Virtually kicking off her Assembly election campaign at the rally, she promised to bring about a holistic change in the fields of infrastructure, health, education and employment, if the Trinamool Congress came to power in the State.

While getting a pet is a random act for many, very few realise the responsibility that comes with it. Sadly, reports of abuse and abandonment of pets either due to old age or illness are on the rise. One must first realise the importance of responsible ownership before making the decision of bringing a pet home. First and foremost, one must understand that companion animals are social beings: they need attention, interaction and love. Anything that compromises these aspects in their lives would result in serious behavioural issues. Pets are very much like children and need to be treated in the same manner – physical punishment and cruel training methods (that cause fear or pain) must not be used against them. Solitary confinement in kennels and tying them up for long periods of time are to be avoided. The health and safety of pets need to be ensured through periodic visits to the veterinarian and keeping vaccinations current. They have to be kept well nourished, groomed, properly exercised and socialised. It is also important to remember that as an animal owner, one has responsibility towards society as well. Simple acts such as using a leash while taking your pet for walks must be followed without fail. One should realise that companion animals have short life spans and it is important to be there for them during the difficult journeys of their lives such as illness and old age. Senior pets need all the reassurance you can give them. Abandoning them during that time is total lack of compassion. A well cared-for pet can provide great enjoyment, companionship and pleasure. Owning a companion animal is therefore a rewarding experience but not without the responsibilities and commitment.

The government has promised to arrange for generator sets, if it is unable to avoid power outages for schools, and will also compensate government-aided high and higher secondary schools and private schools for hiring generators. “The government has said we can hire generator and that it would reimburse the expenditure incurred on diesel for these generators, but we have not received any information on the wattage, where we can hire or who will reimburse the expense,” said the head of a higher secondary school. Dark and stuffy One of the classrooms in the school, even with a tube light on, looked like it could do with some more light. “Till now we had power cuts for an hour but from today it has become two hours,” said a class IX student. “We really don't know how we'll manage this month. Without lights, some of the classrooms get quite dark and it is not easy to hold a class' attention when it is dark or stuffy,” said a teacher at a Chennai Higher Secondary School. He is not alone. Several hundred teachers across schools share the same anxiety. 55,000 schools According to a senior official in the School Education Department, there are nearly 55,000 schools in the State. “We have only been asked to give details of the total number of schools. It is the Energy Department that will have to decide on the procedure for sourcing generators,” the official said. However, attempts to reach senior officials of the Energy Department proved futile. School heads are worried as the class X practical examinations begin mid-March. “We have requested for uninterrupted power supply during the examinations. Our local body has promised to help us,” said N. Vijayan of Zion Matriculation School. Until alternative arrangements are in place, some students might have a difficult time in the classroom. “When we don't switch on the tube lights, the light from outside falls on the black board and those seated in the side rows will not be able to see anything,” said a class VIII student of a Chennai Middle School.",0

ASHOK KUMAR With the stylish ‘Villu,’ Prabhu Deva hopes to recreate the MGR kind of movie, with something for everyone. He started out as a dance master before turning into a celebrity choreographer. Called India’s ‘Michael Jackson’ for his gravity-defying moves on the dance floor, the wiry Prabhu Deva re-invented himself, first as a hero and then as a film director. He now has to his credit three movies in Telugu and one in Tamil. ‘Villu,’ his latest, will hit the silver screen on January 12. The ace dancer-choreographer talks about the film and his work. Excerpts from the interview: ‘Pokkiri’ was a remake. What about ‘Villu’? ‘Villu’ is not a remake. It will be like an MGR film, with positive energy, electrifying performances and ingredients such as songs, fights and sentiment, coupled with beautiful visuals. And this formula will prove to be heady. ‘Pokkiri’ had a lot of raw emotions, but Villu has style. I think it will probably be one of Vijay’s best films. Does Vijay have a double role in it? That’s for people to find out after watching the film! The storyline of ‘Villu’ ? I don’t want to spoil the fun for the audience. But I guarantee that filmgoers will love it and want to watch the film again and again. What are the highlights of ‘Villu’? Vijay’s performance is one. And, Nayanthara, not only tackles the heroine’s role well, but also the comic scenes. She has matched the skills of one of our best comedians — Vadivelu. A great effort! Then, there are a couple of action sequences, which are new to the Tamil screen. These segments will remind you of James Bond movies. Devi Sri Prasad has done a wonderful job with the songs and the re-recording. What is the significance of the title? Well, it has a layered meaning. Like an arrow, the hero has an aim and tries to fulfil it. You are five films old with ‘Villu’. How do you rate yourself as a director? I’ve also done the Hindi version of ‘Pokkiri’ with Salman Khan. It is in the post-production stage. However, I’m unable to rate myself. In fact, I’m yet to get used to the idea of being referred to as a director. I direct a film to the best of my ability — nothing more, nothing less. Of your various avatars such as choreographer, actor, director and now lyricist( Villu), which role is closest to your heart? Dance choreography! Lyric writing was an accident. I made up a few lines and my assistants added a few lines. They had to mention someone’s name as lyricist and asked me whether they could use mine. I reluctantly agreed. But, I want to stress that I don’t want to intrude into or interfere with other departments in this field, now or later.",0

As he began talking to the media, he held a lotus badge in his hand, displaying it prominently before the media along with his inked finger. He also posed with the lotus symbol for a “selfie.” The Election Commission was of the view that this amounted to addressing a public meeting and displaying campaign material. It said Mr. Modi’s address was “intended to influence the result of elections” in constituencies going to the polls on Wednesday.
